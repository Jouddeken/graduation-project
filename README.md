# Product biography
##### Configuration of Design Sprints in Enso
This online document is a collection of all the work I did during my graduation project at MOBGEN | Accenture Interactive. The project is divided into three phases. The concept phase to find out what the problem was, the design phase where I create solutions for the problem and test those and the technical phase.

**The technical phase is the most important phase to me, as development is my specialization.**<br /><br />
