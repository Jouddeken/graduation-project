# Competitor Analysis
###### An analysis of the competitor field of the Enso design sprint app
___

### Industry
Design sprints are a big part of the design thinking method, a method that is being used by big tech companies around the world[^1]. Design thinking is a way of working where a product does not have to be finished before getting feedback on it. You iterate on the project multiple times and every time you want to add a new feature.

A design sprint is a time-constrained, five-phase process that reduces the risks when bringing a new product, service or a feature to the market[^2]. Design sprints are being used to find out how a problem can be solved and how a new feature should look like.

Design thinking is very popular, but according to the hype cycle of Gartner itâ€™s already over the top[^3]. We have to keep an eye out for any new methodology that comes around the corner that is possibly going to be more popular than agile/scrum.

Post Scrum Methodologies is over the top of the cycle in the diagram above.

### Who are the competitors
The Enso application tries to help facilitators run their design sprints, and give participants more insights in the schedule and the events of the design sprint. Enso has two competitors that sort of do the same.

#### Duco[^4]
**_A Design sprint app by New Haircut_**

Duco is a design sprint guide application that helps facilitators of design sprints run through a predefined design sprint agenda. The application is build by New Haircut from New Jersey and is aiming at beginner to intermediate level facilitators. They give you an agenda based on the google design sprint kit, but slightly adjusted to their needs.

The big downside about this application is that the design sprint they offer in their app is not adjustable or personalizable. You have to use their agenda in your design sprints to make use of the application.

####Google Design Sprint Kit[^6]
**_A Design Sprint Website by Google_**

The Google Design Sprint Kit is a template provided and used by Google. It is a three day template where the facilitator guides the participants through five phases. This method is being used at Google, but also at many other places.

The phases of the Google Design Sprint Kit are:
- Understand
- Sketch
- Decide
- Prototype
- Validate

You start the three days with a full day of the understand phase. After that you do the sketch and decide phase in one day, and on the final day you do prototype and validate phases. This method is a rather short one, compared to the others. Most of the design sprint toolkits are 5 days. This competitor gives the user a pdf file that can be used as a presentation, but this presentation cannot be edited.

#### The Sprint Book[^7]
**_A book on how to solve big problems and test new ideas in just five days_**

This book is written by Jake Knapp, John Zeratsky and Braden Kowitz. They describe a 5 day design sprint setup on how to get from an idea to a tested prototype within a week. The book describes a 5 day design sprint, somewhat similar to the google one, but than 2 days longer.

They also have a website where they offer tools, videos and chat support. Besides that they organise design sprint workshops to teach people how to facilitate a design sprint and how to use their book and they have a sprint bot service. The sprint bot service is an automated email service that can help you with the preparations of your design sprint. It does that by sending you emails before the start of the sprint week, and before the start of a sprint day.

This competitor is not really a threat to us. We are using their methodology in the Enso application as well, so they are more like a source of information than a competitor to us.

### Conclusion
There are not a lot of applications that offer the possibility for the facilitator to configure their own sprints. The only tools that help the facilitator are books or pre-made presentations that you can not edit. What Enso is going to offer facilitators will give them more flexibility and freedom on how to design their planning for the workshop.
