# Design
###### Research questions
---
Since design is not my biggest strength and I prefer to focus on development more, I only added two design questions to the project. Initially there were three, but with leaving out the participants version of the app there were now two left.

In these questions I explain how the agenda and event editting works, and how the create sprint flow was designed. I explain the process I followed by referencing to the research I did during the design phase. These questions are a summary and a conclusion for what I have done.

- [Preferred way of creating content on mobile applications](./preferred-way-of-creating-content.md)
