# OUTDATED: What does a participant want to know and get from the application during a design sprint?
###### Concept research question
---

With the application participants can have a better understanding of the sprint process. This includes having a better overview of the details of the Agenda for each day, the details of the for each activity and how long each activity will take.

### 5.1. What information is important for the participant of a design sprint?
Participants need to know the agenda for the design sprint. This can be shared with them via the application before the design sprint. This helps set the expectations for the team of what will happen during the workshop. This can help eliminate worries from participants who are worried about not knowing what will happen during the workshop.

Sharing the agenda for the design sprint will also mean the team will be aligned on what they expect to happen throughout the sprint.

During the design sprint participants need to know the activity instructions, what they need to do and how long they have to complete the task. Participants may also want to have examples of completed tasks in order to better understand, what they are expected to do during the activity.

Participants need to know how much time they have left for a given task. With the timer in the application it is clear how much time for each exercise is left.

### 5.2. Why does the participant want to know this information?
The reason participants need to be informed about all this information is because:
1. Setting expectation of what is going to happen during the workshop
2. Learn more about the design sprint process before the workshop so they are more prepared
3. Participants should know when to expect breaks, and then not worry about when will there be time for lunch or a break during the day.
4. Understanding the time limitations, they have during the day, and while working on a specific task
5. Having a visual reference to the instructions of what they need to do during a task, in case they want a quick reference or the facilitator is not available
