# Preferred way of creating content on mobile applications
###### Design research question
---
The creation of content in the Enso application is creating new design sprints. I did research to this with the pattern research and found a nice way of letting the users create new content in the application. I went for the wizard option where the user has structured format inputs that help the user to understand what values should be filled in.

### What are best practices around user input in a mobile application?
I looked at the following patterns for the creation of a new sprint on a mobile application. To see the detailed pattern description go to the [ create sprint pattern research section](../design/pattern-research/create-sprint.md).

I found three ways:

- Good defaults
- Wizard
- Structured format

In the end I combined the wizard with the structured format to make a create-sprint flow where the user focusses on one input at the time, with the least amount of steps needed to be taken.

### What information is needed to create a sprint and how do you visually request this from the user?
Together with the facilitators at MOBGEN and the Product owner of Enso, Yoav, we made a list of the information that was needed to create a sprint. The list of values we needed was:

| Value | Required |
| :-- | :-- |
| Name | Yes |
| Challenge | No |
| Template | Yes |
| Dates | Yes |
| Participants | No |

With the wizard we could request this information screen by screen from the user, as described in the [create sprint pattern research section](../design/pattern-research/create-sprint.md)
