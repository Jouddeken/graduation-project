# Writing Scalable, Reusable and Maintainable Code
###### Technical research question
---

### What packages or patterns can you use to make the code more clean and efficient?
Good code is consistent code. To enforce consistency in  a project, a developer can use a couple of tools. Using a modern editor (VSCode, WebStorm or something similar) it is possible to add a linter to the code editor. This linter is a program that checks the code as it is being written down. It will give the developer warnings when the code is not consistent or when the code that is written down is outdated or not adviced. There are a couple of linters available, but in the Enso project I used ESLint. When I make a mistake in the code it shows you the following:

- Commenting
- Readme, install instructions
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Dumb components that can be reused in other components

### How can you work with a version control system, and why is it considered indispensable in a project?
- Code reviews & Pull requests (we did this, I have screenshots as well)
- Preventing code loss with Git
- Gitflow workflow/feature branches

### How can you make sure the code you write will work as expected?
- Code reviews & Pull requests (we did this, I have screenshots as well)
- Jest tests (didn't do this, but want to show I know about this and know how to do this)
