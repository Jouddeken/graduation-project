# Writing Scalable, Reusable and Maintainable Code
###### Technical research question
---

### What packages or patterns can you use to make the code more clean and efficient?
- Commenting
- Readme, install instructions
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Dumb components that can be reused in other components

### How can you work with a version control system, and why is it considered indispensable in a project?
- Code reviews & Pull requests (we did this, I have screenshots as well)
- Preventing code loss with Git
- Gitflow workflow/feature branches

### How can you make sure the code you write will work as expected?
- Code reviews & Pull requests (we did this, I have screenshots as well)
- Jest tests (didn't do this, but want to show I know about this and know how to do this)
