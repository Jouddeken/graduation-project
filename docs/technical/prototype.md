## Prototype
###### The latest prototypes I made for iOS and Android
---

The good thing about React Native is that you can develop an Android and iOS app simultaneously with only one codebase. I optimized the prototype for iOS, but still made sure everything worked in Android as well. To use the prototype on your phone follow the steps below:

### Android
1. Scan the QR code or download the [prototype]({{ book.android }}) from this page on an Android phone
2. Press install on the phone
3. The app should open automatically after installing

### iOS
1. Scan the QR code or download the [prototype]({{ book.ios }}) from this page on an iOS phone
2. Press install on the phone
3. Wait for the app to be installed, and click on it. This should show a popup saying 'untrusted developer'
4. Go to Settings > General > Profiles & Device Management
5. Click on MOBGEN B.V. and trust the developer
6. Reopen the application
