# Technical phase
###### How I build the prototype application
---

### What did I want to get to know?
I wanted to find out how I could build a new feature on top of the existing React Native prototype application of Enso. What are the reasons behind using React Native, how is the storage and flow of the data handled in a React Native application, how is a React Native project set up, how do you visually style the components in a smart way?

### What did I do?
* Did research to what a framework is, and why React Native is used for the Enso application
* Did research on how the data is handled in the app, and what patterns are for data in React Native
* Did research on how a React Native project can be set up
* Did research on how to apply styling in React Native
<!-- * Did research on how to work together with other developers that work in the same project but on other features -->

### What did I learn
- It's possible to create a working iOS and Android application with React Native without too many issues
- The React Native framework is a solid base to work with
- Handling data in React Native and Redux is easily extendable but a lot of writing is required
- The project setup plays a big role in the React Native ecosystem
- Styling is similar to web styling with the styled-components library
<!-- - Version control with Git is a great way of working together with colleagues -->
