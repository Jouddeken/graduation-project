###### Programming concepts, packages and tools
---
In this section I describe the packages, methodologies and ways of working applied in this project. I explain how they work and how I applied them in the project, show the alternatives there are, and compare them to the competitors.

I give a solution for the problems I faced in the project, such as choosing a framework, setting up the project, handling all the data, styling components and working with version control.
