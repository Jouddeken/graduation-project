# Design phase
###### What is the solution?
---

### What did I want to get to know?
I wanted to create a solution for the problem I discovered in the concept phase. For that I needed to know the requirements for the designs, and the epics and user stories that the designs should follow. I want to look at other apps and how they solve similar situations as I will run into. After that I want to create a couple of solutions and iterations of the designs. With those iterated designs I want to make a UX prototype, and test that prototype on the target audience, but also on other people to see if they can understand the application. At the end of this phase I want to have designs for an application I can go ahead and develop.

### What did I do?
* Created a [Requirements list](./requirements-list.md)
* Wrote down [Epics and user stories](./epics/epics.md)
* Did [Pattern research](./pattern-research.md)
* Made a [UX prototype](./ux-prototype.md)
* Conducted [UX user tests](./ux-user-tests.md)

### What did I learn
- There are a lot of features we can still add to the Enso application
- Configuring and editing a sprint is more than enough functionality for this project
- Epics and user stories are very nice and handy to have, but hard to write
- Patterns are a good way to find solutions
- An invision prototype is a good way to test your designs
- Good UX testing is difficult
- The design phase is not my specialization
