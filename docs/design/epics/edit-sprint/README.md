# edit-sprint
###### Epic
---
### Description
Make users able to edit the sprints they created in the Enso application.

### Problem
In the current version of the Enso application it is not possible to create sprints and thus to edit created sprints. In the new version a user should be able to edit a created sprint.

### High level proposal
The new feature should be implemented using the new Enso art direction.

### Value to users
Users are able to edit their created sprints.

### Value to MOBGEN
Making users able to edit the sprints is essential for a good user experience. Otherwise, if a user configures a sprint and makes a minor mistake, they have to create a whole new sprint. This feature makes the app look professional and well thought through.
