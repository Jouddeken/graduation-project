# ENS-200: edit-sprint
###### Epic
---
### Description
Make users able to edit the sprints they created in the Enso application. This means the user can do the following:

1. Edit the sprint name (edit-sprint-name)
2. Edit the sprint challenge (edit-sprint-challenge)
3. Edit the sprint template (edit-sprint-template)
4. Edit the sprint start date (edit-sprint-start-date)
5. Edit the number of participants in the sprint (edit-sprint-participants)
6. Edit each sprint days title (edit=sprint-day-titles)
7. Edit each sprint days start time (edit-sprint-day-start-time)
8. Delete a sprint (delete-sprint)

### Problem
In the current version of the Enso application it is not possible to create sprints and thus to edit created sprints. In the new version a user should be able to edit a created sprint.

### High level proposal
The new feature should be implemented using the new Enso art direction.

### Value to users
Users are able to edit their created sprints.

### Value to MOBGEN
Making users able to edit the sprints is essential for a good user experience. Otherwise, if a user configures a sprint and makes a minor mistake, they have to create a whole new sprint. This feature makes the app look professional and well thought through.
