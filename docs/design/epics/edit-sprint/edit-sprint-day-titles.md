#### edit-sprint-day-titles
**As a** user of the Enso application <br />
**I want** to change the created sprints day titles <br />
**So that I** can change them to something that suits my sprint

###### Summary
A user should be able to change the title of any of the days of any of the sprints created. The user should be able to navigate to this screen by clicking on an 'edit' button in the sprints overview screen, and then on one of the days that are listed in that screen. This will take the user to the create-sprint-edit-day screen. On that screen will be a title input where the user can type, paste and edit the text. This feature should be available offline. Screens should follow the new art direction of the Enso application.
