#### ENS-404: edit-event-visual
**As a** user of the Enso application <br />
**I want** to change the visual of the events in my agenda <br />
**So that I** can select one that I like

###### Summary
A user should be able to change the visual of the events in any agenda created. The user should be able to do so by clicking on the 'edit' button in the header on an event screen. The user should be taken to the edit-event screen, where the currently used visual is shown, along with other options the user can choose from. The user can click on any of the other (smaller) options which will make them appear bigger and with a check mark on them to indicate that they are active. By going back or clicking 'save changes' the user should be taken back to the event with updated values. This feature should be available offline. Screens should follow the new art direction of the Enso application.

###### Acceptance criteria
- User can navigate to the edit-event screen from the event screen
- User can see the current visual for this event
- User can change the current visual by clicking on any of the smaller visuals in the list around the larger active one.
- After a click the active visual changes to the one the user selected.
- User can go back using the Android back button or iOS swipe, header back button or the 'save changes' button to save the adjusted values and see them in the event immediately
