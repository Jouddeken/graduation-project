### Introduction
I wrote down a detailed description of every epic, and for every user story in the 4 epics I selected from the requirements list. I selected those epics together with Yoav Farbey (product owner of the Enso application), he thought these 4 epics are good enough for the project, and will take up more than enough time. I wrote the epics following a patterns I learned during my time as a frontend developer intern at MOBGEN. I worked in a Shell project where they wrote the epics and user stories like this as well.

The user stories describe the functionality of a feature, but not the design. It can describe navigational patterns or touch interactions, but it should not say anything about visual styling.

### Epics
- [create-sprint&nbsp;&nbsp;‚û°Ô∏è](./create-sprint/index.md)
- [edit-sprint&nbsp;&nbsp;‚û°Ô∏è](./edit-sprint/index.md)
- [edit-agenda&nbsp;&nbsp;‚û°Ô∏è](./edit-agenda/index.md)
- [edit-event&nbsp;&nbsp;‚û°Ô∏è](./edit-event/index.md)

### Conclusion
It was a lot of work writing down all the functional requirements for every epic and user story, but it is very nice to have everything so clearly written down. This will help with the next step, which is finding patterns for the UX designs I will make.
