#### ENS-302: edit-agenda-mark-completed
**As a** user of the Enso application <br />
**I want** to mark events as completed <br />
**So that I** can keep track of where I am in the sprint

###### Summary
A user should be able to mark events as completed in their agenda. The user should be able to do so by swiping from left to right on any of the events in the agenda. When this is done the event is greyed out and the hyphen changes to a check mark. The user is then able to mark the event as not complete by swiping from left to right on the event. The check mark will dan become a hyphen again and the event will not be greyed out anymore. This feature should be available offline. Screens should follow the new art direction of the Enso application.

###### Acceptance criteria
