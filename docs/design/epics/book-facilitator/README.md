# book-facilitator
###### Epic
---
### Description
Give user the ability to book one of MOBGEN's facilitators from within the app.

### Problem
In the current version it is not possible to book a facilitator from within the app, the app is not breathing the MOBGEN brand enough.

### High level proposal
The new feature should be implemented using the new Enso art direction.

### Value to users
User can get help organizing a sprint from MOBGEN professionals.

### Value to MOBGEN
Adding this feature could lead to more clients for MOBGEN, but also shows that MOBGEN has the knowledge to run design sprints.
