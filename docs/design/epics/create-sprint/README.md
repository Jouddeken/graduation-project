# create-sprint
###### Epic
---
### Description
Make users able to configure their own sprints in the Enso application. This process consists of 5 steps:

1. Setting a sprint name (set-sprint-name)
2. Setting a sprint challenge (set-sprint-challenge)
3. Selecting a sprint template (set-sprint-template)
4. Selection a sprint start date (set-sprint-start-date)
5. Setting the number of participants in a sprint (set-sprint-participants)

### Problem
The current version of the Enso application is not adding enough value without the ability to configure sprints.

### High level proposal
The new feature should be implemented using the new Enso art direction.

### Value to users
User are able to configure their own sprints in the application, based on existing templates that MOBGEN provides.

### Value to MOBGEN
Adding this feature will show off MOBGEN's leading role in the area of design sprints.
