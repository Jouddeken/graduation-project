# Conclusion
###### What came out of the design phase
---

To make the Enso application actually useful I had to design a feature where the facilitator can configure their own sprints. I did this by looking at other patterns in mobile applications, and with those patterns I made a UX prototype. The prototype was tested and the feedback I got out of those tests will be implemented in the technical phase.

I decided **not** to make a whole new version of the UX prototype with the feedback from the tests, to save some time that I could spend on my expertise, development. I did however made some quick and small improvements to the UX prototype, to streamline it a bit more. Those changes are already in the [UX prototype](./ux-prototype.md).

With this phase finished, it is time to actually create the working product in code. Let's continue to the technical phase.
