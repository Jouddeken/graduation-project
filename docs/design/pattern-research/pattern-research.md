# Pattern research üéõ
###### Common solutions to solve problems
---

### Introduction
I did pattern research to find out how other application solve certain design problems. I divided the research into 4 parts, one part for every feature. They are linked below. What I did was looking for other applications that solved a similar problem, looked into how they solved it, and then selected one solution to add to the UX prototype.

### Patterns
- [create-sprint&nbsp;&nbsp;‚û°Ô∏è](./create-sprint.md)
- [edit-sprint&nbsp;&nbsp;‚û°Ô∏è](./edit-sprint.md)
- [edit-agenda&nbsp;&nbsp;‚û°Ô∏è](./edit-agenda.md)
- [edit-event&nbsp;&nbsp;‚û°Ô∏è](./edit-event.md)

### Conclusion
I found some interesting patterns that I could use in the Enso application that I added to the UX prototype. After the pattern research I knew very well how I could sketch my wireframes, and solve the design problems I had.
