# edit-event
###### Design pattern

### Introduction
A created event has the following values:

| Value | Editable |
| :-- | :-- |
| Name | No |
| Description | No |
| Equipment | Yes |
| Tips | Yes |
| Duration | Yes |

For the patterns that I looked at I would like to refer to the [edit-sprint](./edit-sprint.md) patterns, as these two features are very much alike.

### Conclusion
Similar to the edit-sprint feature, I chose to add the single screen form pattern for the edit-event feature as well. It made sense to me to keep the same flow and design decision here as well to keep the application consistent.
