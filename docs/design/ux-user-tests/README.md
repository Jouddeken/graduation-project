# UX User Tests ðŸ“‹
###### What do end users think of the possible solutions?

### Test plan
Before the tests took place I made a plan and questions for the participants. First of all I had to comfort the participants, and make them think aloud. By asking them simple question about their personal lives (for example: 'What is your name?', 'What do you do for a living' and 'Do you know what a design sprint is, and have you ever participated in one?') you get them to talk. This will help during the testing, so they start to think, and talk about the subject and the thing you are trying to test.

The test plan was as follows:

**Introduction**
- Welcome the participant
- Tell participant who you are, what you are doing and why you invited them to be here.
- Thank them for coming and comfort them, they can not make mistakes.
- Ask for there names if not known.
- Ask what they do for a living/at MOBGEN.
- Ask if they know about Enso and about design sprints.
- Give them the prototype and ask them to look at it, without touching the prototype.

**First steps**
- Ask them what they think they are looking at, and what it possibly can do.
- What do they expect from the prototype?
- What would be an amazing feature it could do?

**Dive deeper**
- If they didn't figure out what the application is, give them a brief explanation of it.
- Ask what they now think the application can do for them.

**Create a sprint**
- Ask if they can create a new sprint.
- Ask if they can give the sprint a name, do they know what the name is for?
- Ask if they can give the sprint a challenge, do they know what the challenge is for?
- Ask them to select a 5 day template.
- How would they select a start date for the sprint?
- Ask them how they would set the sprint participants to a number of 6.
- Was this as they expected? What could be improved?

**Edit the sprint**
- How would they edit the sprints start date?
- How would they change the title for day 1 of the sprint?
- Was this as they expected? What could be improved?

**Edit the agenda**
- Let the participant navigate to the agenda overview (all the events in a list)
- Ask them what they are looking at.
- What do they think they can do here?
- Ask how they would mark an event as done.
- Ask how they would delete an event.
- Ask how they would add an event.
- Was this as they expected? What could be improved?

**Edit an event**
- Ask the participant to navigate to the event page.
- Ask them how they would edit the duration of this event.
- Was this as they expected? What could be improved?

**End**
- Ask what could be improved overall in the UX designs.
- Thank them for their time.

### Results
The results of the user tests were:

- There should be a quicker way to navigate back to the home screen when in a sprint
- The timer button on an event screen should indicate the amount of time of the event
- The timer button should be visible in all screens of the app, since it is the most important feature
- Editing the agenda name should also be able by clicking on the name of the agenda in the header
- The steps in the create sprint process should tell what the steps are
- The difference between the templates in the create sprint process should be explained more
- Solution for when a sprint is planned in the weekend, should it be planned on those days or not?
- Being able to tap on the number of participants that shows the numeric keyboard
- Popup when creating a sprint that gives a summary of the sprint
- More information about the upcoming events on the home screen
- The name 'upcoming exercise' is not clear
- The popups on the screen should be vertically centered
