## Reflection
###### On the graduation project
---

The Enso application really needed this feature. It was very clear the application was not useful enough without it. Enso already made a name for itself internally at MOBGEN | Accenture Interactive, and with this new feature we can finally release the application publicly as well.

Yoav Farbey, product owner and initiator of Enso, is very happy with the end result. The frontend team was impressed with what I managed to create in React Native, without the help of Native iOS or Android developers (there was no money for native developers).
Looking back at the project I would have spend less time on concept, because it was clear very soon what the problem with the application was. I could have spend more time on either design or development that way. For design an extra iteration on the UX would have been an improvement. For development more time would have meant more streamlined code, and maybe some cool animations.

Reflecting on the design challenge:

“How could the current Enso application give facilitators of design sprints the possibility to configure and manage workshops in the application for both Android and iOS with a single codebase?”

I think I managed to find a solution for the challenge. I was also able to develop a working prototype for Android and iOS, using a single codebase. This prototype was based on the research to the target audience, best practices for designs, user tests that validated the design decisions and research to project setups and coding best practices. During the project I still kept in mind that React Native could have some performance issues with hardware heavy tasks, this helped me to develop the new feature quickly.

I build a feature that can be released in the next Enso release with a little bit of refactoring and streamlining of the code.
