## [Recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose)
##### What is it?
Recompose is a React utility belt for functions and HOC's (High Order Components), it gives you a toolbox of functions you can use to make your code cleaner and write better HOC's. A higher order component is a function that takes a component as an argument, applies something to that component and returns a new component. Recompose gives a developer the ability to decouple pieces of a React component in a neat and clear way, and reasonably tie them together.

Higher order components are a hard subject to fully understand, and some developers struggle with it for quite some time. The Recompose package gives the developer some standardized HOC functions to use and to make the development process easier. You can see it as the jQuery or Lodash for the React library.

##### Alternatives
- Writing the HOC functions yourself

##### Why Recompose?
Recompose is really specifically made for React. There are no competitors out there that do the same as Recompose does. You can choose to not use Recompose, this would mean writing the HOC's yourself. This is exactly the same as when you use the lodash package, it gives you a bunch of functions you can use in your application. These functions are not extremely hard to make, but are nice to have out of the box and to know they are working correctly. Another benefit of using the Recompose package is again that it is easier to test the functions, which is another reason to use the package.
