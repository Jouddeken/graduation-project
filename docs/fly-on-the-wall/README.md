### Conclusion
During the observation I learned some new things about design sprints and how they are conducted. I saw the process a team goes through when generating new ideas for a possible solution of a problem they have. It is really nice to see how the client is involved in this process. I also saw how Enso was being used, and how release 1 is lacking functionalities to be really useful. I made a [customer journey](./../customer-journey/README.md) around how Enso was used during my observation.
