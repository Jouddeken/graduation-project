# Conclusion
###### What came out of the concept phase
---

The current release of the Enso application, that is available for MOBGEN or Accenture Interactive employees, is a good tool to test if an application is useful during a design sprint workshop. The tools can be of great value, but has one very clear problem that I discovered during the concept phase.

When a facilitator runs a design sprint workshop, he or she needs to have full control over the planning. With the current Enso application this is not possible, and the facilitator has to take too many steps to adjust the planning in the application.

The feature I am going to create should enable the facilitators to create and edit their sprints in the application.
