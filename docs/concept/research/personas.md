###### People that use the Enso application

### What did I do?
I chatted with three facilitators of MOBGEN that have used the Enso application. I asked them questions during the lunch break and tried to learn what frustrates them about Enso, what they would need to have a better experience with the application and some things they would want to have as a nice bonus in the application.

The personas are based on interviews with Valentina Salvi and Icaro Bione, both facilitators at MOBGEN, and chats with participants of design sprints during lunch at the MOBGEN office.

### Conclusion
We have two very different user groups for the application. The first group, facilitators, are the people that are going to use the application intensively. They will configure their own sprints inside the application and will run design sprints together with the second group, participants. The participants kind of passive users, they only read from the app, and do not configure their own sprints. They are fine with an app that is read-only or a slimmed down version of the one the facilitator has.
