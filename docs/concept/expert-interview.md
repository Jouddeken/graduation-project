# Expert interview ðŸŽ¤
###### Talking with the pro's about design sprints and Enso
---

### What did I do?
I held an interview with Valentina Salvi (facilitator/service designer), Yoav Farbey (facilitator/business analyst) and Leanne Pickering (senior designer) about design sprints and the Enso application. I held the interview together with Francesca Danna from the marketing team. Francesca wanted to know more about designing outside of the line, a subject she uses for marketing. I asked questions about the Enso application and how the facilitators and also Leanne used the application.

### Conclusion
The interview was a confirmation of the previous done research about the Enso application. The facilitators emphasized that they need a configuration feature in the Enso app to actually add value to design sprints and that the current version was only useful as a prototype. Besides the confirmation I also got new insights in what design thinking is and how it is applied at MOBGEN. The facilitators wanted Enso to be flexible and configurable.
