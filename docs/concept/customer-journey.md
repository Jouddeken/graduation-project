# Customer Journey ðŸ—º
###### How the facilitator experiences the current Enso application during a design sprint
---

### What did I do?
I made a customer journey of the current version of the Enso application. It shows where the painpoints of the Enso app are, without asking that question directly to the facilitators.

### Conclusion
Overall, the Enso application in it's current version is not the most enjoyable application to work with. If a mistake in, for example, the agenda is found, it is too hard to correct the agenda. Facilitators enjoy the application untill it is not showing the correct content. At that moment the application is not only not enjoyable to work with anymore, it is just not possible for facilitators to work with it at all.

This is a massive painpoint in the current application. The inability to edit the content or agenda inside the application is a must. Facilitators are skipping the application at the moment something unplanned happens. In case of something unexpected happening, they will fall back to the old Excel sheet with the planning and adjust the planning there.
