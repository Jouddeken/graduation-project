### What did I do?
I made an empathy map that reflects to the persona of the facilitator of the Enso app. This empathy map are made to make clear what the target audience is going through, thinks, sees, feels and hears during the usage of the Enso application. They are based on interviews with Valentina Salvi, Yoav Farbey and Icaro Bione, all facilitators at MOBGEN.

### Conclusion
The facilitators are always busy with and thinking about the participants. The participants are employees from the clients, and the clients pays money for the design sprint. The workshop has to be of a certain level and quality, and the facilitators are always thinking about that. The most important thing for the facilitator are keeping everybody focussed during the sprint and coming to an end result.
