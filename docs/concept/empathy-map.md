### What did I do?
I made an empathy map that reflects to the persona of the facilitator of the Enso app. This empathy map are made to make clear what the target audience is going through, thinks, sees, feels and hears during the usage of the Enso application.

The empathy map is based on interviews with Valentina Salvi, Yoav Farbey and Icaro Bione, the fly on the wall observation and my experience in the project. I have been working with the facilitators and with the Enso application for over half a year and got to know a lot about design sprints and facilitators.

### Conclusion
The facilitators are always busy with, and thinking about the participants. The participants are employees from the clients, and the clients pays money for the design sprint. The workshop has to be of a certain level and quality, and the facilitators always have that in their mind. The most important thing for the facilitator is keeping everybody focussed during the sprint and coming to a good end result for the workshop.
