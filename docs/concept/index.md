# Concept phase
###### What is the problem?
---

### What did I want to get to know?
During the concept phase I wanted to get to know what the actual problem was with the application, who my target audience was, and if there were similar applications on the market that could already solve our problem. The concept phase started with user tests with 8 employees from MOBGEN, where we tested the prototype application and asked the participants of the test what could be a killer feature to add to the Enso application.

### What did I do?
* Conducted [User tests](./user-tests.md) with the current release of the Enso application
* Made a [Competitor Analysis](./competitor-analysis.md) to possibly find other solutions
* Did a [Fly on the Wall](./fly-on-the-wall.md) observation during a design sprint
* Made a [Persona](./persona.md) based on the observation and expert interview
* Made a [Empathy Map](./empathy-map.md) based on the observation and expert interview
* Made a [Customer Journey](./customer-journey.md) based on what I saw during the observation
* Did an [Expert Interview](./expert-interview.md) to get more info about the facilitators

### What did I learn
- How people use the current prototype version of the application
- Who our target audience is, facilitators (at MOBGEN)
- How design sprints actually go
- How Enso is being used in a design sprint
- The Enso prototype is a good tool but needs more features
- The Enso application needs to be configurable to the needs and wants of facilitators
