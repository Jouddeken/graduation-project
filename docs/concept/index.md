# Concept Phase
###### What is the problem?
---

### What did I want to get to know?
During the concept phase I wanted to get to know what the actual problem was with the application, who my target audience was, and if there were similar applications on the market that could already solve our problem. The concept phase started with user tests with 8 employees from MOBGEN, where we tested the prototype application and asked the participants of the test what could be a killer feature to add to the Enso application.
