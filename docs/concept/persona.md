# Persona ðŸ‘«
###### People that use the Enso application
---

### What did I do?
I had conversations with three facilitators of MOBGEN that have used the Enso application. These facilitators are also the target audience of the Enso application. I asked them questions and tried to learn what frustrates them about Enso, what they would need to have a better experience with the application and some things they would want to have as a nice bonus in the application. The persona is based on interviews with Valentina Salvi, Yoav Farbey and Icaro Bione, all facilitators at MOBGEN.

**Valentina** is the most experienced facilitator of design sprints at MOBGEN. She has facilitated a lot of design sprints during her time here and knows everything about them.

**Yoav** is a business analyst at MOBGEN and has been in a lot of design sprints as a participant, but also as a facilitator.

Lastly **Icaro** is Lead Product Designer at MOBGEN, and has also been in a quite some design sprints as a facilitator and participant.

### Conclusion
The facilitators are a group of people that take care of the organization and planning of the design sprint workshops. They use a lot of tools to guide their workshops and to make processes understandable for clients. For the planning of these workshops they use Excel, as Yoav told me. I see there is a lot of work done by hand during the planning of a design sprint, and things are not automated.

Based on the needs and wants of the three facilitators at MOBGEN, they would benefit from an application where they can configure their workshops. These three people are not a lot to base a persona on, but they form a global idea of who our user can be.
