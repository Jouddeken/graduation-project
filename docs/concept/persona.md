###### People that use the Enso application

### What did I do?
I had conversations with three facilitators of MOBGEN that have used the Enso application. These facilitators are also the target audience of the Enso application. I asked them questions and tried to learn what frustrates them about Enso, what they would need to have a better experience with the application and some things they would want to have as a nice bonus in the application. The persona is based on interviews with Valentina Salvi, Yoav Farbey and Icaro Bione, all facilitators at MOBGEN.

First of all we have **Valentina**. She is the most experienced facilitator of design sprints at MOBGEN. She has facilitated a lot of design sprints and knows everything about them. At MOBGEN she is the go-to person when there are questions about design sprints or the facilitation of workshops. She has a background in Product & Service design.

**Yoav** is a business analyst at MOBGEN and has been in a lot of design sprints as a participant, but also as a facilitator. Yoav is also the product owner of Enso, and came up with the idea of an application for design sprints. He felt he needed something like an application during design sprints, and gathered a team around him to see if his idea works.

Lastly **Icaro** is Lead Product Designer at MOBGEN, he has been in some design sprints as a facilitator and as a participant. Icaro has almost 10 years of experience in Visual or Product design.

These three people give a base for the facilitator below. I got the information from them while interviewing them during lunch or at the coffee machine, but also because I work with them and speak to them on a regular base. I talk with most of the facilitators at least once or twice a week, to gather information or check if what I think is correct.

Besides that I have been working in the Enso project from the beginning and did user tests with the first version of the application. Some of the information in the persona are assumptions or things I knew from the user tests.

### Conclusion
The facilitators are a group of people that take care of the organization and planning of the design sprint workshops. They use a lot of tools to guide their workshops and to make processes understandable for clients. For the planning of these workshops they use Excel, as Yoav told me. I see there is a lot of work done by hand during the planning of a design sprint, and things are not automated.

Based on the needs and wants of the three facilitators at MOBGEN, they would benefit from an application where they can configure their workshops.
