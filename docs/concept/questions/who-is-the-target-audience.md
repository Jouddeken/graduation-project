# Concept Phase
###### Who is the target audience?

### Who is the target audience?
The target audience of the Enso application can be split up into two groups: **Facilitators** and **Participants**. These two groups have different needs and wants. Facilitators are in control of the workshop they are giving, and participants are only participating in a workshop. Based on the interviews and observations, the facilitators want to be able to create their own sprint in the application and be able to edit it. The facilitators just want to get information like the planning of the day, the descriptions of the exercises and how long they have to finish an exercise.

### What are their needs and wants of the Enso application?
The needs and wants of the target audiences differ a bit from each other. A facilitator wants and needs a lot more from the application to make the application useful. A participant needs and wants less. I have split the needs and wants of the two target audience groups into sub-question.

### What do we have that the competitors donâ€™t have?
In the current version we don't have any extra features that our biggest competitor, Duco, does not have, we probably have less if you are not a MOBGEN employee. Both the Duco and Enso app give the user a design sprint agenda that is not editable. Duco gives the user a design sprint agenda that can practically be used for most of the design sprints. The design sprints in the current Enso app are all customized to suit the clients needs. A random user probably prefers the Duco app over the Enso app because it's everywhere-to-use agenda.

With the addition of the new feature where users can configure their own sprints and edit agendas to make them suit their needs. If the feature is released we have a big advantage over the competition. There is currently no other design sprint tool or workshop tool that allows its users to configure their own workshop in the way we plan to do. We think Enso can be market leader in workshop planning tools with the new feature.
