# Concept Phase
###### What would a facilitator want to do with a design sprint tool?
---
Facilitators want to use the Enso tool to give them structure and flexibility. They want to be able to adapt design thinking methodologies such as the design sprint, to fit the clients and projects they are working on. They want to have a planning that they can share with the participants, and want to be able to adjust that planning even during the sprint or workshop.

### 4.1. Why does a facilitator want to do this?
The Enso tool can provide facilitators with a way to adapt a design thinking methodology to fit the clients and projects they are working on. They can do this using a simple interface, that allows them to move, remove and add activities from their agenda.

Another reason for wanting to use this tool is that it makes the learning curve of understanding the workshop easier, looking at the interviews I carried a lot of the feedback was along the lines of “Anyone could facilitate a design sprint with this”, “I already have a lot more insight in what it takes to run a design sprint” see appendix. This shows the application can help train up facilitators quickly

### 4.2. Is the application the best solution for the goals a facilitator has, or can a different solution give better results?
The facilitators have one big goal during a design sprint, and that is to come to a good solution via a prototype, together with the client. They also have numerous sub-goals during a design sprint. They want all the participants to cooperate with each other to come to a solution, they want everything they tell and explain to be clear and they want to give a participant complete clarity on the planning and how the sprint is going to look like.

There are other options to run a design sprint, but no other option suits the facilitators needs they say. It is the main reason MOBGEN started to look for a custom solution to their problem. The facilitators used to use an Excel sheet for the planning for example, but that did not work perfectly. The Excel sheet had to be shared with the client via a link, so the client could see the planning of the day. If the facilitator wanted to change the duration of an event the Excel sheet did not always recalculate the other event times correctly. This resulted in a planning that did not match the day, or the facilitator changing all the other event times by hand.

It is difficult at the moment to find a good tool that works for the facilitators. Most of the solutions are based on Word documents or Excel sheets, that do not automatically adjust based on the content, or are easily shared with a client. During one of the quick lunch chats with the facilitators I noticed that they are enthusiastic about the next release of the Enso application, because it gives them the ability to adjust a planning quick and easy, and to focus more on the design sprint itself.

For that reason I think there are no other solutions that can solve the problem in an easier way. The facilitators mentioned that they have been searching for a better solution for quite some time, but were not able to find a better alternative than an Excel sheet. They also said that the Excel sheet is not their preferred way of working.
