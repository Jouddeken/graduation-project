# Concept Phase
###### What are the problems a facilitator has with the current Enso application?
---

With the current version of the Enso application the facilitator does not have the option to create or configure their own sprints. If a facilitator wants to run a custom sprint in the application with a custom agenda, he has to get in contact with Yoav Farbey, and ask Yoav to add the sprint agenda to our backend system: Halo. This process takes long and when the facilitator wants to change something it takes a while. When a facilitator wants to edit the duration or the order of some of the events in a certain agenda, Yoav has to change this in Halo. This takes way to long to be done during a sprint.

The main point of criticism the Enso application got is that it is not adaptable enough to the needs and wants of the facilitators. What they want to do in the application, creating their own sprints/workshops, can not be done at the moment.

### 3.1. Why do these problems exist, and in what way are they problems?
These problems exist because the first version of the Enso application was a prototype to test if using an app during a design sprint is useful or not. In the initial release of the application there was one sprint active that was showed to all users. The screen where you can select a specific sprint was not there at all. Later it was clear that the facilitators all ran their design sprints differently, and needed configurable agendas. The fix for that was to add them by hand to the backend system. This was working fine for some time, but it was clear we had to implement this feature in the application.

### 3.2. When do these problems occur and how often?
The problem that the facilitator has, is that during a sprint things change, and so the agenda has to change as well. The problems occur during a sprint, which is a stressful time for the facilitator. The facilitator can not focus on changing backend values during a design sprint. He only has time to change a duration or delete an event from the agenda, so things have to be fast. During one of the interviews with Valentina she told me that it happens often that the duration or the order of events change midway through a design sprint. She also told me that sometimes events get skipped because of lack of time.

### 3.3. Is there a way these problems can be prevented?
The way I think we can prevent these problems is to give facilitators the option to do quick things like removing an event, updating the duration or reordering events in the application. This should be possible to do in a very short period of time, so the facilitator can stay focussed on the design sprint itself, and not on Enso. Enso should not be the focus point during the design sprint, it should even feel natural and quick to update something in Enso.
