###### An observation of a design sprint and the usage of Enso
---

### What did I do?
I sat in a Shell design sprint given by Valentina Salvi. She had two colleagues from MOBGEN in the design sprint as well, Icaro Bione and Marjorie Broudieu. Together with four Shell employees they formed a seven man strong squad to tackle a sprint challenge.

The photos below are from my observation, together with the notes I took during the sprint day.

### Conclusion
During the observation I learned some new things about design sprints and how they are conducted. I saw the process a team goes through when generating new ideas for a possible solution of a problem they have. It is really nice to see how the client is involved in this process. I also saw how Enso was being used, and how release 1 is lacking functionalities to be really useful. I made a [customer journey](./../customer-journey/README.md) around how Enso was used during my observation.
