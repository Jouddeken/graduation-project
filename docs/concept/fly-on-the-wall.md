###### An observation of a design sprint and the usage of Enso
---

### What did I do?
I sat in a Shell design sprint given by Valentina Salvi. She had two colleagues from MOBGEN in the design sprint as well, Icaro Bione and Marjorie Broudieu. Together with four Shell employees they formed a seven man strong squad to tackle a sprint challenge.

I wanted to know how the current Enso application was used during a design sprint by one of the facilitators. I wanted to know what she liked about Enso, if she could work fast with it, what she did not like about it, and what could stop her from working with the application.

The photos below are from my observation, together with the notes I took during the sprint day.

### Conclusion
During the observation I learned some new things about design sprints and how they are conducted. I saw the process a team goes through when generating new ideas for a possible solution of a problem they have. It is really nice to see how the client is involved in this process.

I also saw how Enso was being used, and how release one is lacking functionalities to be really useful. For example, when Valentina noticed that the agenda in the Enso application did not match her planned agenda she could not edit the agenda in the Enso application to solve this problem. Because of a client that is paying for a good and smooth design sprint, she had to switch to her Excel planning to continue the workshop.

The application has some good feature like the timer and the list of energisers that were used during the workshop, but the lack of an edit option for the sprint is a big dealbreaker.

Having only one observation is a bit minimal, but this observation highlighted directly what the biggest flaw in the current release is. Facilitators have to be able to edit the agenda, and have to be able to do this fast.
