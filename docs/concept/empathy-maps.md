# Empathy maps ðŸ¤”

### What did I do?
I made empathy maps that reflect to the personas of the Enso app. These maps are made to make clear what the target audience is going through, thinks, sees, feels and hears during the usage of the Enso application. They are based on interviews with Valentina Salvi and Icaro Bione, both facilitators at MOBGEN, and chats with participants of design sprints during lunch at the MOBGEN office.

### Conclusion
As we saw with the personas, we have two very different target audiences. The facilitators know very well what a design sprint is, and how it's meant to be run. Participants might not know anything at all, and are also busy with other things besides the design sprint. They might have a boss waiting for an answer or some other colleagues asking him questions during a design sprint. Participants are way less focussed on the Enso application than the facilitators.
