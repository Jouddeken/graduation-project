###### Talking with the pro's about design sprints and Enso
---
### What did I do?
I joined an interview with Valentina Salvi (facilitator/service designer), Yoav Farbey (facilitator/business analyst) and Leanna Pickering (senior desginer) about design sprints, designing ouside of the line and the Enso application. The interview was held by Francesca Danna from the marketing team and me. Francesca wanted to know more about the designing ouside of the line subject, and I used the Interview to ask questions about Enso.

### Conclusion
Not much new came from the interview. It is really clear now that we need to add a feature where facilitators can configure their own sprints, and edit those sprints at any time. Valentina does not think Enso is currently adding value to the design sprints, but with the new feature she thinks Enso will be really useful.
