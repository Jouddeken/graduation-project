<h6 id="configuration-of-design-sprints-in-enso">Configuration of design sprints in Enso</h6>
<hr>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>During my internship at MOBGEN from September 2017 until the end of January of 2018 I have worked on several projects. One of them was an application that helps the facilitator of a design sprint run their design sprint workshop. The application is a prototype that is used to test if the idea behind the app is useful to a facilitator. It is also used to discover how to further develop it and how to put the application into the market. After some research and a lot of testing by Yoav (who originally came up with the idea for the application) and also by me and the rest of the Enso team, it became clear that new features were necessary to make the application actually useful. In the current version, the prototype, it is not possible to create your own design sprints in the application. Managing your own design sprints by the user is the most requested feature for the next release after the user testing.</p>
<p>MOBGEN is an Amsterdam based app developer but also has two offices in Spain. One in A Coru&#xF1;a and another one in Malaga. The company is very internationally oriented, and I work together with people from all over the world. That is also the reason why I write documents in English, and not in Dutch. MOBGEN was acquired by Accenture in June 2016 and via Accenture it has a giant pool of very big clients. Examples are: Shell, KPN, ABN-AMRO and AEGON. MOBGEN is still an independent company inside the Accenture brand, with it&#x2019;s own clients and offices, and has around 200 employees.</p>
<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
<p>The prototype of the application, named Enso, is being used extensively in design sprints given at MOBGEN. The facilitators of MOBGEN say it is a great tool that allows them to focus more on the design sprint itself instead of on the planning and structuring of the workshop.<sup><a href="#fn_1" id="reffn_1">1</a></sup> The application takes care of the planning and structuring for them. MOBGEN sees that the application is adding value to the company, but also has a point of criticism: the application can only be used internally at MOBGEN. <strong>The reason the application is currently only usable internally at MOBGEN because when someone want to add a sprint, he or she has to contact Yoav and ask him to add the agenda to the Halo Backend System.</strong></p>
<p>The most important features of Enso are the sprint agenda, the timer, the list of energisers and the shopping list. The sprint agenda is the planning for the design sprint the facilitator wants to host. The week is divided in days and the days have events. The events are exercises that the facilitator does with the participants of the design sprint to come up with ideas for a problem the client has. In the design sprint are always employees of the clients company to bring in the internal knowledge about the company.</p>
<p><img src="https://jobouddeken.nl/images/enso.png" alt="Screenshots of the Enso application"></p>
<p>MOBGEN and the facilitators at MOBGEN would like to see a feature where users of the application, facilitators, can build their own agendas without having to use a separate backend system. This means we have to make the facilitators able to configure their own sprints in the application.<sup><a href="#fn_1" id="reffn_1">1</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="context">Context</h3>
<h4 id="stakeholders">Stakeholders</h4>
<h5 id="facilitators">Facilitators</h5>
<p>The target audience of the application are people that are facilitating or participating in a design sprint. The first group are the people that are facilitating these design sprint workshops, we call them facilitators. The facilitators are facilitating the workshop and want to create an agenda that reflects their needs and wants. They also want to adjust the agenda when needed, for example when one of the events can not take place because equipment is missing or broke down. Facilitators want to be in full control of the content in their design sprint agenda, and want to be able to change it whenever and wherever they are.<sup><a href="#fn_1" id="reffn_1">1</a></sup></p>
<h5 id="participants">Participants</h5>
<p>On the other hand we have the people that are joining and participating in a design sprint, these people can be clients, but also colleagues of the facilitator. These users have a different role and want to do different things than the facilitator. We call this group participants. The participants want to see the agenda and read back what events were about. They also want to know when they have lunch and at what time the day ends.<sup><a href="#fn_1" id="reffn_1">1</a></sup> Both the facilitators and participants are users of the application, but they use the application different. Facilitators actually have the application installed on their phone and navigate through the agenda, participants only watch the agenda on the big screen in the meeting room the design sprint is given in. The initial idea was to also make a read-only navigation for the participants which they can download to check out the design sprint agenda, but that feature is for a later moment.</p>
<h5 id="mobgen">MOBGEN</h5>
<p>Finally we have MOBGEN as a stakeholder in the project. MOBGEN is the company that finances the project, and allows me to work on it. In a conversation with members of the board of MOBGEN <sup><a href="#fn_2" id="reffn_2">2</a></sup>, they made clear that they want their brand to come forward into the app and to be able to use the application as a marketing tool. With the application they want to emphasize their leading position in the area of design sprints. The members of the board of MOBGEN we spoke to consisted of Ron Vrijmoet, CEO of the company <sup><a href="#fn_3" id="reffn_3">3</a></sup>, Nick Mueller, CCO of company <sup><a href="#fn_4" id="reffn_4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<h4 id="trends">Trends</h4>
<p>Design sprint are a trend in the current creative businesses. The methodology was created by Google Ventures, and was used to improve Google Chrome, Gmail and Google Search. The design sprint methodology is now also used by other big companies like Facebook, Slack and Airbnb <sup><a href="#fn_5" id="reffn_5">5</a></sup>. The method is used by these big companies because: &#x201C;Companies are getting better and quicker results with the design sprint methodology than with the design thinking process&#x201D; as Jonathan Courtney states.<sup><a href="#fn_6" id="reffn_6">6</a></sup> It is important to state that design thinking and design sprints are two separate methodologies. The same goes for agile/scrum, design sprints are not part of agile/scrum, but can be really useful in that workflow. However, the design thinking methodology is applied during a design sprint. The design sprint is a short period of time, mostly 3 or 5 days, where a team together with the client creates a tested prototype.</p>
<p>There are a lot of trends in and around mobile app development. One of them is React Native, the technology that has been used to build the prototype application of Enso <sup><a href="#fn_7" id="reffn_7">7</a></sup>. React Native covers both the iOS and Android platforms, and the code that is written is pure JavaScript which can be used on the web as well. With React Native it is possible for one developer to build an iOS, Android and a web interface with just one language.</p>
<p>Another trend is Progressive Web Apps. This trend is quite new and is not workable yet on iOS, but Apple is working on an update of the iOS software to make this possible <sup><a href="#fn_8" id="reffn_8">8</a></sup>. Progressive Web Apps are expected to be a big thing because of the following reasons: It&#x2019;s faster than a native application, it does not require an install procedure from the App or Play store and you have access to offline functionalities with service workers.<sup><a href="#fn_9" id="reffn_9">9</a></sup></p>
<h4 id="opportunities">Opportunities</h4>
<p>The area we aim to serve with the application currently only has one big active competitor. The competitor is another application that tries to help their users run through their design sprints, called Duco <sup><a href="#fn_10" id="reffn_10">10</a></sup>. MOBGEN thinks they can have an advantage over Duco if Enso gets the new configuration function, and can become way bigger than the competition with an additional reporting system that is also being build simultaneously with this project. Enso could become a much better tool than Duco in our opinion, and we think Enso has a lot of potential to grow into a big tool.</p>
<p>There are other tools facilitators of design sprints and workshops could use, like the Google Design Sprint Kit <sup><a href="#fn_11" id="reffn_11">11</a></sup>, or The Sprint Book by Jake Knapp <sup><a href="#fn_12" id="reffn_12">12</a></sup>, but none of these tools give the facilitator an application where they can configure agendas that are specific for clients. The Enso application uses a lot of the exercises that are written down in the Google Design Sprint Kit and The Sprint Book as well. With the Enso application you can use both of these tools, and combine them to make your workshop work. We are not really a competitor to the Google Design Sprint Kit or The Sprint Book.</p>
<h4 id="threats">Threats</h4>
<p>The biggest threat we face is that the design sprints lose popularity over time. The research company Gartner developed a diagram that can be used to determine if a method is at the top of it&#x2019;s hype or not. They use the Gartner Hype Cycle Diagram for this, showed in the image below. Gartner believes that &#x2018;Post-Scrum methodologies&#x2019; are already over their peak <sup><a href="#fn_13" id="reffn_13">13</a></sup>. &#x2018;Post-Scrum&#x2019; includes all agile/scrum methodologies in their diagram.</p>
<p>&#xA0;
<img src="https://jobouddeken.nl/images/gartner-hype-cycle.png" alt="Gartner Hype Cycle"></p>
<p>Design sprints are not necessary in an agile/scrum project, but can be really useful. Design sprints can also be used outside of a agile/scrum system, and were introduced way after agile/scrum was introduced. We have to be aware that design sprints can lose their value and the industry will move to another method where Enso cannot be used anymore.</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong><br>
<em><strong>&#x201C;How could the current Enso application give facilitators of design sprints the possibility to configure and manage workshops in the application for both Android and iOS with a single codebase?&#x201D;</strong></em></p>
<p>I decided to make the design challenge focusing on the technical part of the project, which is where I have been specializing in during the study. The technical part is for me the most important part in this project, and is also the field I am going to work in after the study. I want to use this project to show that I can create outstanding technical solutions, but still know how to do concept and design parts in a project.</p>
<p>I changed the design challenge after a week or 12 in the project, when the feedback I got was that I was not focussing on my expertise enough. I made it focus more on the technical part of the project, so I could also focus more on that part.</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong><br>
I decided to drop question 5 because the information was not necessary anymore for the feature I was going to make after changing the design challenge. At the start of the project the idea was to make a separate application for facilitators as well, where they can see the design sprint agenda. This was too much work in the time I had.</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong><br>
I decided to drop question 3 because the information was not necessary anymore for the feature I was going to make after changing the design challenge. At the start of the project the idea was to make a separate application for facilitators as well, where they can see the design sprint agenda. This was too much work in the time I had.</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong><br>
I decided to drop question 2.2 because to save time in design and spend more time in development I decided to make the designs for iOS and Android the same.</p>
<h3 id="focus">Focus</h3>
<p>I want to do what I love, which for me is building a technical solution for a problem. I am specializing in the Frontend Developer role and have been focussed on development for the biggest part of my studies. During this project I want to show that I can create outstanding technical solutions, but still know how to do concept and design parts in a project.</p>
<h3 id="product-vision">Product vision</h3>
<p>The current app is already a great tool for facilitators based on the feedback we have gotten back from them at MOBGEN. I think this tool can not only be used at design sprints, but also with any other workshop one might want to give. This tool can become something really big, and fill in a gap in the current market. There is currently one similar app worth mentioning in this market, called Duco, but it doesn&#x2019;t have the features the facilitators really need, as we already found out during some interviews.<sup><a href="#fn_1" id="reffn_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In the future Enso could become the workshop tool everybody wants to use, we have the opportunity to add the features the facilitators really need and want.</p>
<h3 id="possible-impact-of-the-product">Possible impact of the product</h3>
<p>Enso could become the market leader in workshop facilitator tools, because this market is relatively empty. There are not a lot of tools that help someone facilitate a workshop. You can find a lot of lists on the internet about how to facilitate a workshop, but none of them actually help the facilitator with custom solutions.</p>

<p>After answering these questions I will have a clear idea what the problem is and what the concept of the project is. The result of answering these questions will be mostly documents with text, but also personas, empathy maps and customer journey. At the end I will have the requirements lists and the user stories to work from and make the UX designs.</p>

<p>By answering these questions I will have the UX sketches that I can use to start the prototype. The UX sketches will be tested with the target audience and their feedback will be used to improve the UX sketches. The end result of these questions will be a document where I describe the design choices that were made, and an invision prototype of all the UX screens.</p>

<p>The decisions made on the technical part will be done based on the research of the above questions. These questions will help me make the right decisions in the code base to create a product that can be picked up by another developer, but also can be used to add new features to the application.</p>
<h3 id="planning">Planning</h3>
<p><img src="https://jobouddeken.nl/images/planning.png" alt="Project planning"></p>
<h5 id="planning-description">Planning description</h5>
<p>I made a planning for the weeks that are still to come. In every week you can see which research question I will tackle, what activities I will take place to do so, and what documents or files will be delivered.</p>
<p>The planning starts with the concept phase. It will take me only two weeks, which seems a bit short at first sight, but I have done quite some research in week 1 till 6, so I can reuse most of that to do the concept phase.</p>
<p>After the concept phase I will start with the design phase. In this phase I will translate the concept to a design that can solve the found problems. I will do some iterations on the designs based on user tests with real end-users.</p>
<p>When the designs are finished I will start with the development of the feature. The end product will be a React Native prototype that allows a participant to create their own sprints in the application. All design or technical decisions will be backed by research that is done during the project.</p>
<p>The full planning is available via this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fe8AlPRZcAEi3cYq_WSzRiAzKV5D9_j00ZQsqEQb1PU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">link</a>.</p>
