MOBGEN | Accenture Interactive. The project is divided into three phases. The concept phase to find out what the problem was, the design phase where I create solutions for the problem and test those and the technical phase.\nThe technical phase is the most important phase to me, as development is my specialization.\n\n\nStudent:           Job Ouddeken\nSpecialization:    Development\nMentor:            Sonja Rouwhorst\nClient:            MOBGEN | Accenture Interactive\nDate:              -\nVersion:           2.0.0\n\n\n\nApplication download links\nFor install instructions see the prototype page.\n\n  \n    Download iOS application ‚Äî (api)\n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    Download Android application ‚Äî (apk)\n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nDesign rationale download link\n\n  \n    Download design rationale ‚Äî (pdf)\n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nProduct biography download link\nA pdf export of this website.\n\n  \n    Download product biography ‚Äî (pdf)\n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n"},"docs/design-brief/":{"url":"docs/design-brief/","title":"Design brief","keywords":"","body":"Design brief üì´\nConfiguration of design sprints in Enso\n\nIntroduction\nDuring my internship at MOBGEN from September 2017 until the end of January of 2018 I have worked on several projects. One of them was an application that helps the facilitator of a design sprint run their design sprint workshop. The application is a prototype that is used to test if the idea behind the app is useful to a facilitator. It is also used to discover how to further develop it and how to put the application into the market. After some research and a lot of testing by Yoav (who originally came up with the idea for the application) and also by me and the rest of the Enso team, it became clear that new features were necessary to make the application actually useful. In the current version, the prototype, it is not possible to create your own design sprints in the application. Managing your own design sprints by the user is the most requested feature for the next release after the user testing.\nMOBGEN is an Amsterdam based app developer but also has two offices in Spain. One in A Coru√±a and another one in Malaga. The company is very internationally oriented, and I work together with people from all over the world. That is also the reason why I write documents in English, and not in Dutch. MOBGEN was acquired by Accenture in June 2016 and via Accenture it has a giant pool of very big clients. Examples are: Shell, KPN, ABN-AMRO and AEGON. MOBGEN is still an independent company inside the Accenture brand, with it‚Äôs own clients and offices, and has around 200 employees.\nProblem\nThe prototype of the application, named Enso, is being used extensively in design sprints given at MOBGEN. The facilitators of MOBGEN say it is a great tool that allows them to focus more on the design sprint itself instead of on the planning and structuring of the workshop.1 The application takes care of the planning and structuring for them. MOBGEN sees that the application is adding value to the company, but also has a point of criticism: the application can only be used internally at MOBGEN. The reason the application is currently only usable internally at MOBGEN because when someone want to add a sprint, he or she has to contact Yoav and ask him to add the agenda to the Halo Backend System.\nThe most important features of Enso are the sprint agenda, the timer, the list of energisers and the shopping list. The sprint agenda is the planning for the design sprint the facilitator wants to host. The week is divided in days and the days have events. The events are exercises that the facilitator does with the participants of the design sprint to come up with ideas for a problem the client has. In the design sprint are always employees of the clients company to bring in the internal knowledge about the company.\n\nMOBGEN and the facilitators at MOBGEN would like to see a feature where users of the application, facilitators, can build their own agendas without having to use a separate backend system. This means we have to make the facilitators able to configure their own sprints in the application.1\nContext\nStakeholders\nFacilitators\nThe target audience of the application are people that are facilitating or participating in a design sprint. The first group are the people that are facilitating these design sprint workshops, we call them facilitators. The facilitators are facilitating the workshop and want to create an agenda that reflects their needs and wants. They also want to adjust the agenda when needed, for example when one of the events can not take place because equipment is missing or broke down. Facilitators want to be in full control of the content in their design sprint agenda, and want to be able to change it whenever and wherever they are.1\nParticipants\nOn the other hand we have the people that are joining and participating in a design sprint, these people can be clients, but also colleagues of the facilitator. These users have a different role and want to do different things than the facilitator. We call this group participants. The participants want to see the agenda and read back what events were about. They also want to know when they have lunch and at what time the day ends.1 Both the facilitators and participants are users of the application, but they use the application different. Facilitators actually have the application installed on their phone and navigate through the agenda, participants only watch the agenda on the big screen in the meeting room the design sprint is given in. The initial idea was to also make a read-only navigation for the participants which they can download to check out the design sprint agenda, but that feature is for a later moment.\nMOBGEN\nFinally we have MOBGEN as a stakeholder in the project. MOBGEN is the company that finances the project, and allows me to work on it. In a conversation with members of the board of MOBGEN 2, they made clear that they want their brand to come forward into the app and to be able to use the application as a marketing tool. With the application they want to emphasize their leading position in the area of design sprints. The members of the board of MOBGEN we spoke to consisted of Ron Vrijmoet, CEO of the company 3, Nick Mueller, CCO of company 4.\nTrends\nDesign sprint are a trend in the current creative businesses. The methodology was created by Google Ventures, and was used to improve Google Chrome, Gmail and Google Search. The design sprint methodology is now also used by other big companies like Facebook, Slack and Airbnb 5. The method is used by these big companies because: ‚ÄúCompanies are getting better and quicker results with the design sprint methodology than with the design thinking process‚Äù as Jonathan Courtney states.6 It is important to state that design thinking and design sprints are two separate methodologies. The same goes for agile/scrum, design sprints are not part of agile/scrum, but can be really useful in that workflow. However, the design thinking methodology is applied during a design sprint. The design sprint is a short period of time, mostly 3 or 5 days, where a team together with the client creates a tested prototype.\nThere are a lot of trends in and around mobile app development. One of them is React Native, the technology that has been used to build the prototype application of Enso 7. React Native covers both the iOS and Android platforms, and the code that is written is pure JavaScript which can be used on the web as well. With React Native it is possible for one developer to build an iOS, Android and a web interface with just one language.\nAnother trend is Progressive Web Apps. This trend is quite new and is not workable yet on iOS, but Apple is working on an update of the iOS software to make this possible 8. Progressive Web Apps are expected to be a big thing because of the following reasons: It‚Äôs faster than a native application, it does not require an install procedure from the App or Play store and you have access to offline functionalities with service workers.9\nOpportunities\nThe area we aim to serve with the application currently only has one big active competitor. The competitor is another application that tries to help their users run through their design sprints, called Duco 10. MOBGEN thinks they can have an advantage over Duco if Enso gets the new configuration function, and can become way bigger than the competition with an additional reporting system that is also being build simultaneously with this project. Enso could become a much better tool than Duco in our opinion, and we think Enso has a lot of potential to grow into a big tool.\nThere are other tools facilitators of design sprints and workshops could use, like the Google Design Sprint Kit 11, or The Sprint Book by Jake Knapp 12, but none of these tools give the facilitator an application where they can configure agendas that are specific for clients. The Enso application uses a lot of the exercises that are written down in the Google Design Sprint Kit and The Sprint Book as well. With the Enso application you can use both of these tools, and combine them to make your workshop work. We are not really a competitor to the Google Design Sprint Kit or The Sprint Book.\nThreats\nThe biggest threat we face is that the design sprints lose popularity over time. The research company Gartner developed a diagram that can be used to determine if a method is at the top of it‚Äôs hype or not. They use the Gartner Hype Cycle Diagram for this, showed in the image below. Gartner believes that ‚ÄòPost-Scrum methodologies‚Äô are already over their peak 13. ‚ÄòPost-Scrum‚Äô includes all agile/scrum methodologies in their diagram.\n¬†\n\nDesign sprints are not necessary in an agile/scrum project, but can be really useful. Design sprints can also be used outside of a agile/scrum system, and were introduced way after agile/scrum was introduced. We have to be aware that design sprints can lose their value and the industry will move to another method where Enso cannot be used anymore.\n\nDesign challenge\n‚ÄúHow could the current Enso application give facilitators of design sprints the possibility to create their own design sprint agendas and give participants of those design sprints better information about the agenda during the design sprint?‚Äù\nedit:\n‚ÄúHow could the current Enso application give facilitators of design sprints the possibility to configure and manage workshops in the application for both Android and iOS with a single codebase?‚Äù\nI decided to make the design challenge focusing on the technical part of the project, which is where I have been specializing in during the study. The technical part is for me the most important part in this project, and is also the field I am going to work in after the study. I want to use this project to show that I can create outstanding technical solutions, but still know how to do concept and design parts in a project.\nI changed the design challenge after a week or 12 in the project, when the feedback I got was that I was not focussing on my expertise enough. I made it focus more on the technical part of the project, so I could also focus more on that part.\n\nResearch questions\nConcept\n\nWhat is a design sprint and how do you facilitate one?\n1.1. What is the goal of a design sprint?\n1.2. What is the normal procedure for a design sprint?\n1.3. Which people take part of a design sprint?\nWho is the target audience?\n2.1. What are their needs and wants of the Enso application?\n2.2. What do we have that the competitors don‚Äôt have?\nWhat are the problems a facilitator has with the current Enso application?\n3.1. Why do these problems exist, and in what way are they problems?\n3.2. When do these problems occur and how often?\n3.3. Is there a way these problems can be prevented?\nWhat would a facilitator want to do with a design sprint tool?\n4.1. Why does a facilitator wants to do this?\n4.2. Is the application the best solution for the goals a facilitator has, or can a different solution give better results?\nWhat does a participant want to know and get from the application during a design sprint?\n5.1. What information is important for the participant of a design sprint?\n5.2. Why does the participant want to know this information?\n\nedit:\nI decided to drop question 5 because the information was not necessary anymore for the feature I was going to make after changing the design challenge. At the start of the project the idea was to make a separate application for facilitators as well, where they can see the design sprint agenda. This was too much work in the time I had.\nDesign\n\nWhat is the preferred way of creating a new sprint on a mobile application?\n1.1. What information is needed to create a sprint and how do you visually request this from the user?\n1.2. What are best practices around requesting values from a user in a mobile application?\nWhat are the best practices around agendas and events for mobile applications?\n2.2. How do you give the user the ability to edit an existing agenda?\n2.2. How do you give the user the ability to edit an existing sprint or event?\nHow does the participant view differ from the facilitator view?\n3.1. How do you give a participant access to a facilitators design sprint?\n3.2. What are best practices around requesting access in a mobile application?\n\nedit:\nI decided to drop question 3 because the information was not necessary anymore for the feature I was going to make after changing the design challenge. At the start of the project the idea was to make a separate application for facilitators as well, where they can see the design sprint agenda. This was too much work in the time I had.\nTechnical\n\nWhat are the restrictions of React Native?\n1.1. How can you solve those restrictions?\n1.2. What other alternatives are there instead of React Native?\n1.3. What are advantages of React Native?\nWhat are the best practices is designing a mobile application codebase in React Native?\n2.1. What different ways are there to set up a project?\n2.2. How do you deal with the differences between iOS and Android technically?\n2.3. How do you deal with all the side effects that happen on mobile?\nHow can you write scalable, reusable and maintainable code in React Native?\n3.1. What packages or patterns can you use to make the code more clean and efficient?\n3.2. How can you work with a version control system, and why is it considered indispensable in a project?\n3.3. How can you make sure the code you write will work as expected?\n\nedit:\nI decided to drop question 2.2 because to save time in design and spend more time in development I decided to make the designs for iOS and Android the same.\nFocus\nI want to do what I love, which for me is building a technical solution for a problem. I am specializing in the Frontend Developer role and have been focussed on development for the biggest part of my studies. During this project I want to show that I can create outstanding technical solutions, but still know how to do concept and design parts in a project.\nProduct vision\nThe current app is already a great tool for facilitators based on the feedback we have gotten back from them at MOBGEN. I think this tool can not only be used at design sprints, but also with any other workshop one might want to give. This tool can become something really big, and fill in a gap in the current market. There is currently one similar app worth mentioning in this market, called Duco, but it doesn‚Äôt have the features the facilitators really need, as we already found out during some interviews.1\nIn the future Enso could become the workshop tool everybody wants to use, we have the opportunity to add the features the facilitators really need and want.\nPossible impact of the product\nEnso could become the market leader in workshop facilitator tools, because this market is relatively empty. There are not a lot of tools that help someone facilitate a workshop. You can find a lot of lists on the internet about how to facilitate a workshop, but none of them actually help the facilitator with custom solutions.\nRoadmap & planning\nConcept\n\n\n\n#\nResearch question\nActivities\nDeliverables\n\n\n\n\n1\nWhat is a design sprint and how do you facilitate one?\nInterviews with some facilitatorsInterviews with participantsResearch on the web\nDesign briefRoadmapExpert interview notes\n\n\n2\nWho is the target audience?\nMaking personas based on the interviews done earlierMaking empathy maps based on the interviews done earlier\nPersonas target audienceEmpathy maps target audience\n\n\n3\nWhat are the problems a facilitator has with the current Enso application?\nObservation during a design sprintInterview with the facilitator of the design sprint about what does not work in Enso\nObservation notesInterview notesCustomer Journey\n\n\n4\nWhat would a facilitator want to do with a design sprint tool?\nSketching possible solutions based on previous researchTesting those solutions with end-users\nRequirements list facilitatorUser stories facilitator\n\n\n5\nWhat does a participant want to know and get from the application during a design sprint?\nInterviews with participants about what they want from Enso during a design sprint\nRequirements list participantUser stories participant\n\n\n\nAfter answering these questions I will have a clear idea what the problem is and what the concept of the project is.

At the end I will have the requirements lists and the user stories to work from and make the UX designs.\nDesign\n\n\n\n#\nResearch question\nActivities\nDeliverables\n\n\n\n\n6\nWhat is the preferred way of creating a new sprint on a mobile application?\nDesk research to best practices around content creation in mobile applicationsUX sketches that can be used to test the possible solutions\nBest practices research documentUX sketches\n\n\n7\nWhat are the best practices around agendas and events for mobile applications?\nDesk research to best practices around agendas and showing events in mobile applicationsUX sketches that can be used to test the possible solutions\nAddition to best practices research documentUX sketches\n\n\n8\nHow does the participant view differ from the facilitator view?\nUX sketches for a possible flow to invite participants to a facilitators sprint\nUser test notes and outcomes to iterate on\n\n\n\nBy answering these questions I will have the UX sketches that I can use to start the prototype.

In every week you can see which research question I will tackle, what activities I will take place to do so, and what documents or files will be delivered.\nThe planning starts with the concept phase. It will take me only two weeks, which seems a bit short at first sight, but I have done quite some research in week 1 till 6, so I can reuse most of that to do the concept phase.\nAfter the concept phase I will start with the design phase. In this phase I will translate the concept to a design that can solve the found problems. I will do some iterations on the designs based on user tests with real end-users.\nWhen the designs are finished I will start with the development of the feature. The end product will be a React Native prototype that allows a participant to create their own sprints in the application. All design or technical decisions will be backed by research that is done during the project.\nThe full planning is available via this link.\nReferences\n\n1. Ouddeken, J. (2017, November 20th).

The goal of the user tests was to find out what each participant thought about the application, how they managed to use the navigation and if the content was clear. We also wanted to know from the participants that participated in design sprints before, if they thought the application could be of value during a design sprint.\nPrior to the testing we made a testplan that every tester could follow. The whole Enso team helped to run these user tests, so we made a powerpoint presentation that everybody was going to follow during the testing. In every test we had a test lead, who would ask the questions, and a notetaker, who would write down all the info. We also recorded almost all the tests using a webcam. With this test plan I helped in 8 of the 13 tests, where I was the leading the test in 5 of those cases. In the other 3 tests I was the notetaker.\n\nTest plan\nThe test plan the Enso team wrote together consisted of the following:\nGeneral Questions\nIntroduction questions\n\nWhat is your role at MOBGEN?\nHave you ever run or participated in a workshop at MOBGEN?\nWas the workshop a design sprint?\n(If no) Do you know what a design sprint is?\nDid you find any pain points when running or participating in the workshop?\n\nContext\nSetting the scene\n\nYou are a workshop facilitator at MOBGEN.\nYou have been tasked with preparing for an upcoming design sprint using Enso.\nEnso is an application built to help facilitators run work shops and the next set of tasks and questions will be around the usability of this application.\n\nFirst impressions\nOpen up Enso!\n\nWithout touching / exploring the application\nWhat are your first impressions?\nWhat do you think this app is able to do?\nWhat would you hope this application contains?\nWhat do you think of what you are seeing?\n\nBegin exploring\nTask 1\n\nCould you find and tell me the first activity of the design sprint?\nOnce selected: What is your impression of what you are seeing?\nCould you describe the information you see in this activity?\nWhat do you think the grey tags mean?\nWithout navigating: How would you navigate to the next activity?

Most of the participants understood the application very well, and knew how they could fulfill the tasks we asked them to do during the tests. The most heard point of criticism was that the agenda was too static. The participants could not edit the agenda to make it work for them.\nThere were also some small navigational or visual points of criticism that could be solved with a redesign. Contentwise there are some parts that can be greatly improved and maybe some explanations here and there could solve a lot of confusion for the users of the application.\n"},"docs/concept/competitor-analysis.html":{"url":"docs/concept/competitor-analysis.html","title":"Competitor analysis","keywords":"","body":"Competitor analysis üìà\nAn analysis of the competitor field of the Enso design sprint app\n\nIntroduction\nI did a competitor analysis to find out if there were other applications or resources that we could use instead of developing our own custom application. I looked for similar applications on the AppStore and online. The applications had to be able to support a facilitator during a design sprint, and give him or her some useful tools and extras to work with.\nIndustry\nDesign sprints are a big part of the design thinking method, a method that is being used by big tech companies around the world1. Design thinking is a way of working where a product does not have to be finished before getting feedback on it. You iterate on the project multiple times and every time you want to add a new feature.\nA design sprint is a time-constrained, five-phase process that reduces the risks when bringing a new product, service or a feature to the market2. Design sprints are being used to find out how a problem can be solved and how a new feature should look like.\nDesign thinking is very popular, but according to the hype cycle of Gartner it‚Äôs already over the top3. We have to keep an eye out for any new methodology that comes around the corner that is possibly going to be more popular than agile/scrum.\n\nPost Scrum Methodologies is over the top of the cycle in the diagram above.\nWho are the competitors\nThe Enso application tries to help facilitators run their design sprints, and give participants more insights in the schedule and the events of the design sprint. Enso has two competitors that sort of do the same.\nDuco4\nA Design sprint app by New Haircut\nDuco is a design sprint guide application that helps facilitators of design sprints run through a predefined design sprint agenda. The application is build by New Haircut from New Jersey and is aiming at beginner to intermediate level facilitators. They give you an agenda based on the google design sprint kit, but slightly adjusted to their needs.\nThe big downside about this application is that the design sprint they offer in their app is not adjustable or personalizable. You have to use their agenda in your design sprints to make use of the application.\nThe Duco application screenshots:5\n\nGoogle Design Sprint Kit6\nA Design Sprint Website by Google\nThe Google Design Sprint Kit is a template provided and used by Google. It is a three day template where the facilitator guides the participants through five phases. This method is being used at Google, but also at many other places.\nThe phases of the Google Design Sprint Kit are:\n\nUnderstand\nSketch\nDecide\nPrototype\nValidate\n\nYou start the three days with a full day of the understand phase. After that you do the sketch and decide phase in one day, and on the final day you do prototype and validate phases. This method is a rather short one, compared to the others. Most of the design sprint toolkits are 5 days. This competitor gives the user a pdf file that can be used as a presentation, but this presentation cannot be edited.\nThe Sprint Book7\nA book on how to solve big problems and test new ideas in just five days\nThis book is written by Jake Knapp, John Zeratsky and Braden Kowitz. They describe a 5 day design sprint setup on how to get from an idea to a tested prototype within a week. The book describes a 5 day design sprint, somewhat similar to the google one, but than 2 days longer.\nThey also have a website where they offer tools, videos and chat support. Besides that they organise design sprint workshops to teach people how to facilitate a design sprint and how to use their book and they have a sprint bot service. The sprint bot service is an automated email service that can help you with the preparations of your design sprint. It does that by sending you emails before the start of the sprint week, and before the start of a sprint day.\nThis competitor is not really a threat to us. We are using their methodology in the Enso application as well, so they are more like a source of information than a competitor to us.\nConclusion\nThere are not a lot of applications that offer the possibility for the facilitator to configure their own sprints. The only tools that help the facilitator are books or pre-made presentations that you can not edit. What Enso is going to offer facilitators will give them more flexibility and freedom on how to design their planning for the workshop.\nThe difference between the competitors and the future release of Enso with the create sprint feature is that the facilitator can configure his or her sprint in the application. This is not possible with any of the competitors.\nReferences\n\n1. Digital Surgeons, (25-01-2017). 5 big organizations winning with design thinking.

She had two colleagues from MOBGEN in the design sprint as well, Icaro Bione and Marjorie Broudieu. Together with four Shell employees they formed a seven man strong squad to tackle a sprint challenge.\nI wanted to know how the current Enso application was used during a design sprint by one of the facilitators. I wanted to know what she liked about Enso, if she could work fast with it, what she did not like about it, and what could stop her from working with the application.\nThe photos below are from my observation, together with the notes I took during the sprint day.\nPhotos\n\n\n\n\nClick on the images for a larger version.\nNotes\n\n\n\nClick on the images for a larger version.\nConclusion\nDuring the observation I learned some new things about design sprints and how they are conducted. I saw the process a team goes through when generating new ideas for a possible solution of a problem they have. It is really nice to see how the client is involved in this process.\nI also saw how Enso was being used, and how release one is lacking functionalities to be really useful. For example, when Valentina noticed that the agenda in the Enso application did not match her planned agenda she could not edit the agenda in the Enso application to solve this problem. Because of a client that is paying for a good and smooth design sprint, she had to switch to her Excel planning to continue the workshop.\nThe application has some good feature like the timer and the list of energisers that were used during the workshop, but the lack of an edit option for the sprint is a big dealbreaker.\nHaving only one observation is a bit minimal, but this observation highlighted directly what the biggest flaw in the current release is. Facilitators have to be able to edit the agenda, and have to be able to do this fast.\n"},"docs/concept/persona.html":{"url":"docs/concept/persona.html","title":"Persona","keywords":"","body":"Persona üë´\nPeople that use the Enso application\n\nWhat did I do?\nI had conversations with three facilitators of MOBGEN that have used the Enso application. These facilitators are also the target audience of the Enso application. I asked them questions and tried to learn what frustrates them about Enso, what they would need to have a better experience with the application and some things they would want to have as a nice bonus in the application. The persona is based on interviews with Valentina Salvi, Yoav Farbey and Icaro Bione, all facilitators at MOBGEN.\nFirst of all we have Valentina. She is the most experienced facilitator of design sprints at MOBGEN. She has facilitated a lot of design sprints and knows everything about them. At MOBGEN she is the go-to person when there are questions about design sprints or the facilitation of workshops. She has a background in Product & Service design.\nYoav is a business analyst at MOBGEN and has been in a lot of design sprints as a participant, but also as a facilitator. Yoav is also the product owner of Enso, and came up with the idea of an application for design sprints. He felt he needed something like an application during design sprints, and gathered a team around him to see if his idea works.\nLastly Icaro is Lead Product Designer at MOBGEN, he has been in some design sprints as a facilitator and as a participant. Icaro has almost 10 years of experience in Visual or Product design.\nThese three people give a base for the facilitator below. I got the information from them while interviewing them during lunch or at the coffee machine, but also because I work with them and speak to them on a regular base. I talk with most of the facilitators at least once or twice a week, to gather information or check if what I think is correct.\nBesides that I have been working in the Enso project from the beginning and did user tests with the first version of the application. Some of the information in the persona are assumptions or things I knew from the user tests.\n\nConclusion\nThe facilitators are a group of people that take care of the organization and planning of the design sprint workshops. They use a lot of tools to guide their workshops and to make processes understandable for clients. For the planning of these workshops they use Excel, as Yoav told me. I see there is a lot of work done by hand during the planning of a design sprint, and things are not automated.\nBased on the needs and wants of the three facilitators at MOBGEN, they would benefit from an application where they can configure their workshops.\n"},"docs/concept/empathy-map.html":{"url":"docs/concept/empathy-map.html","title":"Empathy map","keywords":"","body":"Empathy map ü§î\nSee/say/do/hear/think/want/fear\n\nWhat did I do?\nI made an empathy map that reflects to the persona of the facilitator of the Enso app. This empathy map are made to make clear what the target audience is going through, thinks, sees, feels and hears during the usage of the Enso application.\nThe empathy map is based on interviews with Valentina Salvi, Yoav Farbey and Icaro Bione, the fly on the wall observation and my experience in the project. I have been working with the facilitators and with the Enso application for over half a year and got to know a lot about design sprints and facilitators.\n\nConclusion\nThe facilitators are always busy with, and thinking about the participants. The participants are employees from the clients, and the clients pays money for the design sprint. The workshop has to be of a certain level and quality, and the facilitators always have that in their mind. The most important thing for the facilitator is keeping everybody focussed during the sprint and coming to a good end result for the workshop.\n"},"docs/concept/customer-journey.html":{"url":"docs/concept/customer-journey.html","title":"Customer journey","keywords":"","body":"Customer journey üó∫\nHow the facilitator experiences the current Enso application during a design sprint\n\nWhat did I do?\nI made a customer journey of the current version of the Enso application. It shows where the painpoints of the Enso app are, without asking that question directly to the facilitators. The customer journey is based on the Fly on the wall, Persona and Empathy map, and describes how to product journey was during the observation.\nI realise I only did one observation in one design sprint, but the situation that occurred in that workshop was one that was deal breaking for the application. The situation in the design sprint was a situation where the facilitator could not use the Enso application anymore. This is a situation we want to avoid all the time at all cost, and needs a solution.\n\nConclusion\nOverall, the Enso application in it's current version is not the most enjoyable application to work with. If a mistake in, for example, the agenda is found, it is too hard to correct the agenda. Facilitators enjoy the application until it is not showing the correct content. At that moment the application is not only not enjoyable to work with anymore, it is just not possible for facilitators to work with it at all.\nThis is a massive painpoint in the current application. The ability to edit the content or agenda inside the application is a must have feature. Facilitators stop using the application at the moment something unplanned happens. In case of something unexpected happening, they will fall back to the old Excel sheet with the planning and adjust the planning there.\n\nAbove is an example of a word document that the facilitators used to run a design sprint. This kind of document was used when the planning in the Enso application was not correct anymore.\n"},"docs/concept/expert-interview.html":{"url":"docs/concept/expert-interview.html","title":"Expert interview","keywords":"","body":"Expert interview üé§\nTalking with the pro's about design sprints and Enso\n\nWhat did I do?\nI held an interview with Valentina Salvi (facilitator/service designer), Yoav Farbey (facilitator/business analyst) and Leanne Pickering (senior designer) about design sprints and the Enso application. I held the interview together with Francesca Danna from the marketing team. Francesca wanted to know more about designing outside of the line, a subject she uses for marketing. I asked questions about the Enso application and how the facilitators and also Leanne used the application.\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThe interview was a confirmation of the previous done research about the Enso application. The facilitators emphasized that they need a configuration feature in the Enso app to actually add value to design sprints and that the current version was only useful as a prototype. Besides the confirmation I also got new insights in what design thinking is and how it is applied at MOBGEN. The facilitators wanted Enso to be flexible and configurable.\n"},"docs/concept/conclusion.html":{"url":"docs/concept/conclusion.html","title":"Conclusion","keywords":"","body":"Conclusion\nWhat came out of the concept phase\n\nThe current release of the Enso application, that is available for MOBGEN or Accenture Interactive employees, is a good tool to test if an application is useful during a design sprint workshop. The tools can be of great value, but has one very clear problem that I discovered during the concept phase.\nWhen a facilitator runs a design sprint workshop, he or she needs to have full control over the planning. With the current Enso application this is not possible, and the facilitator has to take too many steps to adjust the planning in the application.\nThe feature I am going to create should enable the facilitators to create and edit their sprints in the application.\n"},"docs/design/":{"url":"docs/design/","title":"Design phase","keywords":"","body":"Design phase\nWhat is the solution?\n\nWhat did I want to get to know?\nI wanted to create a solution for the problem I discovered in the concept phase.

I want to look at other apps and how they solve similar situations as I will run into. After that I want to create a couple of solutions and iterations of the designs. With those iterated designs I want to make a UX prototype, and test that prototype on the target audience, but also on other people to see if they can understand the application.

After the pattern research I knew very well how I could sketch my wireframes, and solve the design problems I had.\n"},"docs/design/pattern-research/create-sprint.html":{"url":"docs/design/pattern-research/create-sprint.html","title":"create-sprint","keywords":"","body":"create-sprint\nDesign pattern\nIntroduction\nFor the creation of the sprint, we need data from the user. This data needs to be in a specific format. Beforehand we sat down with the Enso team, and thought about which data we needed from the user. We ended up with the following list:\n\n\n\nValue\nRequired\n\n\n\n\nName\nYes\n\n\nChallenge\nNo\n\n\nTemplate\nYes\n\n\nDates\nYes\n\n\nParticipants\nNo\n\n\n\nThe challenge and participants are values that are not required, but the facilitators mentioned that they would like to see this feature in the concept phase. They wanted to use the challenge as a description for the sprint, or maybe just put the name of the client there. Participants would default to a value of 7, which is the preferred number of participants in a design sprint according to Tim H√∂fer, product designer at AJ&Smart, who has done over 100 of design sprints.1\nOption 1 ‚Äî Good defaults 2\nThe first option I thought of was a good default option. In this case the application would guess what values you want to fill in for the screen.\n\nThe above image comes from the skyscanner website. The site automatically selects a return ticket, requests your location to put the nearest airport as your 'from' location, sets the return and depart dates on today and tomorrow and selects a ticket for 1 adult. This helps the user to minimize the values he or she has to fill in.\nOption 2 ‚Äî Wizard 3\nLastly I thought about creating a wizard for the flow. According to wikipedia a wizard is: \"A software wizard or setup assistant is a user interface type that presents a user with a sequence of dialog boxes that lead the user through a series of well-defined steps.\" 4\nThe most well known example of a wizard are the installation wizards you get when installing new programs on your computer.\n\nThese wizard guide the user through the process by asking questions to the user. Most of the times the wizards have default values the user can use to install or setup the program.\nOption 3 ‚Äî Structured format 5\nThe second option was a structured format option, that is also frequently used in payment applications and webshops. This pattern is most of the times really similar to the wizard pattern. The difference between the wizard and this pattern is that in this pattern the user is given a structure where he or she can fill in the data. For example a calendar date picker, or dropdowns. The example below comes from the zalando iOS application.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\nThe structured format gives the user a clear view of how many steps there are still to be taken, and what these steps are. It also gives the user a 'structure' to use when filling in the data.\nConclusion\nThe smart defaults option sounds like a good solution for getting the data we need, but after talking with the facilitators and designers at MOBGEN they explained that this might not be the best decision. The name, challenge and dates of the design sprints are so specific for each sprint, that the application cannot guess them correctly.\nThe wizard might be a better solution because it forces the user to focus on a specific part of the process. Combined with the structured data pattern, that is also a sort of wizard, it might be a good solution to get the data we need.\nIn the end the structured data pattern is the preferred option for our problem, and would give the user the best guidance when entering the information. Downside of this pattern is that there are a lot of navigational changes when filling in the information.\nReferences\n\n1. H√∂fer, T. (2018, March 15th). All You Need to Run a Design Sprint.

The user should be able to edit these values when clicking on an 'edit' button when on the sprint overview screen.\nOption 1 ‚Äî WYSIWYG editor 1\nAn option for editing the sprint values could be a What You See Is What You Get editor. The WYSIWYG pattern is most of the time used for desktop applications, where there is more space on the screen and you don't have to display a keyboard on the screen.\n\nThis pattern is really nice for writing documents, or getting long text data input from a user. But the task we are trying to complete in the Enso application is getting short values from the user. The patterns in mainly focussed on desktop as well.\nOption 2 ‚Äî Single screen form\nAnother option is to put every value the user can change on one screen. This would give the user a good overview of which values can be changed, and you can categorize some values as well. This pattern is often seen in account settings, as seen in the two examples below.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\nWhat would happen when a user clicks on any of the values, the keyboard show up, and the user can edit the value.\nOption 3 ‚Äî Inplace editor 2\nThe third option I thought of was the inplace editor. This means that a user can click on a value when it is displayed in the application. We could use this pattern on mobile when the user long presses on the title of the sprint, a keyboard shows up and he or she can edit the sprint title. Yet, with the lack of space on mobile screens, this might not be the best solution.\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\nAbove is an example of an inplace editor. The user can click on a value and that value becomes editable on the spot. We could use this option with a long press on mobile. When the user long-presses on an editable value the keyboard shows up and the user can edit the value. Downside of this pattern is that it might not be totally clear what is editable and what is not.\nConclusion\nComparing these three options I chose to add the second one, single screen form,  to the UX prototype that I was going to test. I went for that option because in the application we do not have long texts that have to be editted, and we only have a couple of values that need to be edittable. This option also gives the user a nice overview of all the values that can be editted, and the user can scroll through the options without having to guess if they can edit it or not.\nReferences\n\n1.

The events are in a list in the current version of the Enso application, and that list worked good. With the next release we are adding some features to this list, most of them are edit features.\nThe features we were going to add to the existing agenda events list are:\n\nMark event as done\nRemove event\nReorder event\nAdd event\n\nOption 1 ‚Äî Edit mode\nThe first pattern I looked at was the pattern that is used in the iOS clock application. In this application they have a list of clocks that display the time around the world. These clocks could be the events in the case of the Enso application. The user has an edit and add button. In the case of the clock application they are placed in the top of the screen. With the edit button the user 'activates' the edit-mode. The red delete icon and the three horizontal lines appear on every item, to indicate a delete and reorder action.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\nAfter clicking on the red delete button the item moves to the left to reveal the actual delete button. This forces the user to do at least two actions, and prevents accidental deletion of items (clocks). When clicking on the three horizontal drag lines the item turns slightly transparant and the user can drag the item around the screen. When clicking the plus, the user is taken to another screen where he or she can select a new clock to add to the list.\nOption 2 ‚Äî Single item edit\nAnother option I looked at was single edit mode. In this mode the user can edit a single item at any given point in time, without having to enable an edit mode. This pattern is found in the messages application on iOS devices. The user sees a list of messages and can swipe from right to left to reveal options. There is an 'edit' button that activates a similar edit mode as described in the pattern above.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\nThis option is probably faster compared to the first option when the user wants to edit a single item, but when there are more than two option for the user, the menu that slides out might get cluttered with too many options.\nOption 3 ‚Äî Mass edit\nThe third option I looked at was mass edit mode, where the user can edit many items at once. This pattern also has an edit mode, that activates the checkboxes on the left side of the items. The user can select the items he or she wants to do something with, and with the bar in the bottom of the screen perform an action on them. With this option the user can delete or move multiple items at once, which is faster than doing it one by one for every item.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\nConclusion\nAfter reviewing the options above I chose the first option to be added to the UX prototype to be tested. This was because it offered the possibility to add events with an add button, and enabling the edit mode with a button. When the user was in the edit mode he or she could drag the events around with the drag handles on the right, and remove the item with the delete button on the left. I also had to add a function where the user could mark an event as done, that could be done by swiping from left to right on an item.\nThe single item edit would be too cluttered with options with three functionalities in the swipeout menu: mark as done, delete and drag. And the mass edit option would be a nice feature to add later in the project. For the first version it was enough to delete events one at the time. This decision would also speed up the development phase.\n"},"docs/design/pattern-research/edit-event.html":{"url":"docs/design/pattern-research/edit-event.html","title":"edit-event","keywords":"","body":"edit-event\nDesign pattern\nIntroduction\nA created event has the following values:\n\n\n\nValue\nEditable\n\n\n\n\nName\nNo\n\n\nDescription\nNo\n\n\nEquipment\nYes\n\n\nTips\nYes\n\n\nDuration\nYes\n\n\n\nFor the patterns that I looked at I would like to refer to the edit-sprint patterns, as these two features are very much alike.\nConclusion\nSimilar to the edit-sprint feature, I chose to add the single screen form pattern for the edit-event feature as well.

I would look at design patterns that proofed to work in other applications, and applied them to my screens, sometimes changing some things a bit or combining two patterns on one screen.\nI would make 2 or 3 options for each screen, and discuss with Alejandro Cruz Moreno, designer for Enso and Shell and has worked for many clients as a UX or UI designer. I would also show my designs to Lan Belic, who is a senior UX designer at MOBGEN. Lan has also worked at the Enso project and for the Shell apps and websites. They would give me feedback on my designs and helped me to come to a final solution that we could test. I chose not to test all the options I had to save some time in the design process, and to be able to spend more time on development, as development is my specialization.\nCreate sprint flow\nFor these screens I created 3 options that might work. I looked at payment flow patterns of Zalando and other webshops, where the user has to be guided through a couple of steps. Option 1 was a long screen where all the necessary information could be filled in. Option 2 was a flow where the application itself tried to choose the correct values for the information itself, and the user could edit them later. The last option, option 3, was a wizard like flow, where the user was presented one input on every screen and had to actively press next to go to the next input.\nOption 1\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\nOption 2\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\nOption 3\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\nAfter showing these screens to Alejandro and Lan we decided that the first or the third option were the best ones. The second option was not realistic because every design sprint is so specific in it's name, challenge and date that you could not expect the application to guess those values correctly. The first option was a good one, but compared to the third option we all preferred the wizard like flow. It forces the user to focus on a single input and prevents the mobile phone's keyboard to be over any of the inputs.\nAfter we chose the wizard option, I got some feedback from the two designers. I made a new version where I changed the step indicator a bit, and the order of inputs. The template is now the third step in the flow, so we know the number of days the sprint is going to take, and we can display that on the datepicker screen.\nBesides that I added a short description for every template option, so the user can read something about the template. Lastly I changed the number of participants to be 7 by default, as that is the suggested amount of participants in a design sprint.\nOption 3 - iteration\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\nEdit sprint flow\nFor these screens I looked at applications where the user can edit values. Examples for this are user accounts where you can edit your name, email or other information. Examples of this are Facebook, Twitter, Uber, Snapchat, Marktplaats and Instagram. I chose to follow the design pattern of Marktplaats and Instagram, where the user can edit a value by clicking on the input. After the click the keyboard will appear on the screen the user currently is at. The other examples had an extra navigational step, where the user is taken to the next screen after clicking on a value.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\nLan and Alex found my option a good one, and agreed to put this flow in the UX prototype we were going to test. I did not make any other options beside a couple of iterations on this version, to speed up the design phase and make more time for development.\nEdit agenda flow\nFor the edit agenda flow, my screens are highly influenced by the iOS clock application. This application has a list of all the clock the user has on his or her phone. We have a similar list, but our list has all the events in it. The clock application gives the user a couple of functionalities. A user can add, remove, drag and edit clocks. We have those actions as well on this screen, as stated in the user story. On our screen we have one extra action, which is the mark as done.\nThis resulted in the following UX sketches:\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\nAfter clicking on add event the user is taken to a screen where he can select events, energisers or other events to add to the agenda. The user can click on any of the events, and the event will be added to the bottom of the agenda.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\nAs said I made a couple of options of the screens that had to get a UX design. When I had some things done I would discuss them with the two experts, Alejandro and Lan, and we would select a version of the screen we were going to put in the UX prototype we were going to test. Below is an example of how my sketch file looked like.\n\n  \n\n\n\n  .j-btn, .j-btn:visited {\n    display: inline-block;\n    background: #0c7feb !important;\n    border-radius: 2px;\n    color: #fff !important;\n    font-weight: bold;\n    margin-left: auto;\n    padding: 12px 16px 4px;\n    text-decoration: none;\n    transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out;\n  }\n  .j-btn:active, .j-btn:hover, .j-btn:focus  {\n    text-decoration: none !important;\n  }\n  .j-btn--icon {\n    display: inline-block;\n    padding-left: 8px;\n    vertical-align: -6px;\n  }\n\n\n\n  \n    Download workfile ‚Äî (sketch)\n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n"},"docs/design/ux-prototype.html":{"url":"docs/design/ux-prototype.html","title":"UX prototype","keywords":"","body":"UX prototype üñç\nHow does the solution work?\n\nIntroduction\nAfter creating all the UX sketches and discussing the best solutions with the two experts, Alejandro and Lan, I created an Invision prototype with their help.\nPrototype\n\n"},"docs/design/ux-user-tests.html":{"url":"docs/design/ux-user-tests.html","title":"UX user tests","keywords":"","body":"UX user tests üìã\nWhat do end users think of the possible solutions?\n\nTest plan\nBefore the tests took place I made a plan and questions for the participants.

By asking them simple question about their personal lives (for example: 'What is your name?', 'What do you do for a living' and 'Do you know what a design sprint is, and have you ever participated in one?') you get them to talk. This will help during the testing, so they start to think, and talk about the subject and the thing you are trying to test.\nThe test plan was as follows:\nIntroduction\n\nWelcome the participant\nTell participant who you are, what you are doing and why you invited them to be here.\nThank them for coming and comfort them, they can not make mistakes.\nAsk for there names if not known.\nAsk what they do for a living/at MOBGEN.\nAsk if they know about Enso and about design sprints.\nGive them the prototype and ask them to look at it, without touching the prototype.\n\nFirst steps\n\nAsk them what they think they are looking at, and what it possibly can do.\nWhat do they expect from the prototype?\nWhat would be an amazing feature it could do?\n\nDive deeper\n\nIf they didn't figure out what the application is, give them a brief explanation of it.\nAsk what they now think the application can do for them.\n\nCreate a sprint\n\nAsk if they can create a new sprint.\nAsk if they can give the sprint a name, do they know what the name is for?\nAsk if they can give the sprint a challenge, do they know what the challenge is for?\nAsk them to select a 5 day template.\nHow would they select a start date for the sprint?\nAsk them how they would set the sprint participants to a number of 6.\nWas this as they expected?

The application was tested using invision which gave the participants the actual native look and feel of an application. This helped with testing the navigation setup. Most of the designs were clear to the participants, and they knew how to work with the application. One of the vague things was the 'upcoming exercise' on the landing page, which was not clear enough for the participants. Most of the feedback that was giving were points on how to improve a current idea, which they thought was working pretty well already.\n"},"docs/design/conclusion.html":{"url":"docs/design/conclusion.html","title":"Conclusion","keywords":"","body":"Conclusion\nWhat came out of the design phase\n\nTo make the Enso application actually useful I had to design a feature where the facilitator can configure their own sprints.

Neha Choudhary gave a great explanation on a StackOverflow page that describes a framework very well:\n\nIf I told you to cut a piece of paper with dimensions 5m by 5m, then surely you would do that. But suppose I ask you to cut 1000 pieces of paper of the same dimensions. In this case, you won't do the measuring 1000 times; obviously, you would make a frame of 5m by 5m, and then with the help of it you would be able to cut 1000 pieces of paper in less time. So, what you did was make a framework which would do a specific type of task. Instead of performing the same type of task again and again for the same type of applications, you create a framework having all those facilities together in one nice packet, hence providing the abstraction for your application and more importantly many applications.\n-- Nahe Choudhary\n\n\nIn summary, a framework is a tool that you can use to create or do something. This works very well for developing applications, where developers often do the same tasks multiple times and maybe a minor detail changes. A framework can help developers create new projects quicker. It is good to note that you don't necessarily need to use a framework for a lot of projects, but for bigger projects it can be very nice to have a set of pre-made functions and a structure you can already use.\nThe framework used in the Enso application is React Native.\nWhat is it?\nReact Native is the native version of the React.js library used for the web. Native means that this library is for Android and iOS devices. It allows a developer to create a cross-platform application with a single codebase. The React Native code compiles to Objective-C and Java, which can be run on iOS and Android respectively. By that way you create native apps with Javascript code. The framework was developed by Facebook, who also made the React.js library for the web. React Native is being used by Facebook itself but also by Airbnb, Skype, Tesla and Wallmart. 1\nAlternatives 2\nThere are some alternatives for React Native:\n\nIonic\nPhoneGap/Cordova\nXamarin\nProgressive Web Apps\nFlutter\nNative iOS and native Android\n\nWhy React Native?\nThe top two options, Ionic and PhoneGap/Cordova, simply wrap a web-view in a native component. This results in a webpage in an app. The applications are slow and cannot make use of some of the native functionalities like Touch ID. Xamarin does give the user the experience of a native app, but it is written in C#. It compiles the C# code to an iOS and an Android application, which would mean for me to learn a whole new language.\nProgressive Web Apps are also a good option, you can still write javascript code and run it on an Android or iOS device. The application runs in the browser on the users device. At the beginning of the Enso project PWA's were not fully supported on iOS, and MOBGEN preferred a native app that you can download from the AppStore and PlayStore.\nThe next big think in cross-platform area is possibly Flutter, the React Native of Google. The framework is written in the Dart language, which also means that I had to learn a new language to work on the project. It also was not officially released as a beta when the Enso project was started, so it was not advised to use in real world projects. 3\nThe main reason I decided to use React Native was of the fact that one developer was able to create both the iOS and the Android app from one codebase. The Enso project is on a tight budget (no budget), it can only make use of intern developers, and most of the time there is only one intern assigned to the project. That is also the reason I did not go for a native iOS and Android application. Another reason is that I was assigned to the Enso project and did not know how to make native iOS and Android apps.\nAnother reason was that MOBGEN is working a lot with React, and in the case of a web version of the application, a lot of the code from the React Native project could be used in a React for web project. It is also easy for another developer to continue the work on the project as React Native does not differ much from React.\nLastly, React Native has a very big community behind it. There are a lot of packages from the React community that can also be used in React Native, but there are also a lot of packages made specifically for React Native by the community.\nThe other options are not necessarily bad options, but React Native was for this project and for MOBGEN the best solution as it had most of the things that were needed. A downside of React Native is that it is not as performant as a native app, and that some functionalities where you want to make use of native components such as Touch ID are hard to do and sometimes impossible, although more and more packages that support these kind of features are being released every day. 4\nPro's of React Native 5 6\n\nWritten in a known language (Javascript)\nBig community with a lot of packages\nWell known (React) by the MOBGEN developers, so easily transferable to another developer\nFaster/cheaper development with a smaller team\n\nCon's of React Native 5 6\n\nNative developer still needed for usage of native functionalities\nIt's difficult to make the navigation work correctly and easily on both platforms\nFacebook rules, massively relying on one company\nJust not as fast/smooth as real native apps\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

This can be a lot of data, or a small bit of data, depending on the size of the application. Data is often created and modified in an application, and sometimes stored on the users device itself, or even on a remote server. For storing data, it is nice to have a certain pattern to follow. For the Enso project I worked with the Redux way of working to handle data.\nWhat is it?\nRedux is a way of storing your data in your app. It does that by putting all your data in a global 'store'. The store is the place where all the data of your app lives, and if anything changes, that store will also change.\nRedux has three core principles:\n\nSingle source of truth\nState is read-only\nChanges are made with pure functions\n\nRedux is initially hard to grasp, but it is best explained using a flow chart.\n\n\nIn the flow an event is dispatched from the view, this is our starting point. This event is clicking a button, for example.// When the user presses this button, the onPress function is fired!\n action()} />\n\n\nThis click event fires an action that describes what happened.\nconst action = () => ({\n  type: 'BUTTON_CLICK', // notice the type: 'BUTTON_CLICK', the type is used later as well and should describe the action.\n});\n\nThis is a so called pure function. It returns the same object every time it is called.\n\nThis action goes through some middleware. Middleware is where data fetching calls, and normalization of the data take place.\n\nIt the goes into a so called 'reducer' that takes the current state of the 'store', applies the action changes to that 'store' and returns a new copy of the 'store' that is an updated version of the 'store'\nconst reducer = (state = {}, action) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'BUTTON_CLICK': // This is our action!\n      return {\n        ...state, // this is where we take a copy of the state\n        isButtonClicked: true, // and apply the new value to that copy\n      }\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n}\n\n\nThe new state is then returned to the view, and triggers a re-render of the view.\nFor example: if we used to have a state that looked like this:const state = {\n  name: 'example name',\n  isButtonClicked: false,\n  isConnected: true,\n};\n\nWe would have a state that looks like this after the button click:const state = {\n  name: 'example name',\n  isButtonClicked: true, // This changed with our action!\n  isConnected: true,\n};\n\nThe important thing to notice is that Redux makes a copy of the state, it does not overwrite values. This means the state is immutable.\n\nRedux is a very nice way to implement a very scalable way of working with data in your app. You can use Redux for small apps, but it's overkill for most of the applications. Only when the user can do multiple things in the application and adjust values, it might be a good idea to implement Redux.\nThe downside of Redux is that you have to edit three files to create one action. The view itself, the action and the reducer.\nAlternatives\n\nMobX\nRxJs\nRealm\n\nWhy Redux?\nRedux is more manual than MobX, and for the Enso project that is what I needed. This means you need to write more code yourself, which can be seen as a downside. The code you write is however easily testable and extremely predictable, which is considered a good practice. I wanted to have full control over what my data structure looked like. Redux gave me this functionality.\nRealm is only usable by React Native and node.js applications, and because there were some vague plans of making a web port of the React Native application I wanted to use as much packages as possible that could be used on Native and web.\nThe reason I chose for Redux is because of the many packages I can integrate into the Redux environment. Examples of those packages are Redux Saga, Reselect and Redux Persist. These packages are also being used in web apps, so that is a big bonus in the reusable aspect of the code. Redux is also very well supported by a massive community, and has a great documentation. Besides that, a lot of developers at MOBGEN are working with Redux, so it is easier to find help when I have questions or problems.\n"},"docs/technical/project-structure.html":{"url":"docs/technical/project-structure.html","title":"Project structure","keywords":"","body":"Project structure\nHow was the project folder structure setup and why?\n\nThe project is set up following a set of simple rules that work well with the React framework and specially with the Redux way of working.\nWhat is it?\nSmart and Dumb components is a way of organizing your React application. There are many other names for this concept. Some people call them Container and Presentational components, Smart and Dumb components or Stateful and Pure components. The core concept of it is that one of the two is taking care of all the business logic, and the other one of displaying the data.\nIn my case this would mean that Smart components are the place where fetching data from an external source takes place and any other functions like navigating. Inside this Smart component live some dumb components. They do not have any functionality and only take care of displaying the data in a way the designer wants.\nThis means that Smart components:\n\nAre concerned with how things work\nMay contain both Smart and Dumb components inside them, but never set any styles\nProvide the data and behavior to other components inside of them\nAre made with class [name] extends React.Component { class }\nConnect with the Redux store via the connect() function\nAre stateful (have state)\nExamples of Smart Components: TabBar, HomeScreen, HeaderBar\n\nThis means that Dumb components:\n\nAre concerned with how things look\nAre completely separated from the rest of the app\nDo not specify how the data is loaded/fetched/mutated\nReceive data and callbacks exclusively via props\nRarely have their own state (only UI state like if something is folded out or not)\nAre written as functional components using a function [name] ({ ...props }) { function }\nExamples: H1, OrderedList, Image\n\nIn short, this means Smart components do all the data handling and pass the correct data to the dumb components. The dumb components simply render the given data, and can be easily reused in other Smart components.\n\nThe codebase should have the following structure when following this pattern:\n - src\n   - components\n     - Component1\n       - index.js\n     - Component2\n       - index.js\n     - etc...\n   - containers\n     - Container1\n       - actions.js\n       - constants.js\n       - index.js\n       - reducer.js\n       - sagas.js\n       - selectors.js\n     - Container2\n       - actions.js\n       - constants.js\n       - index.js\n       - reducer.js\n       - sagas.js\n       - selectors.js\n     - etc...\n\nAlternative\nSome people prefer to keep all actions, constants, reducers, sagas and selectors in one file. This is a nice approach when the application is smaller, and does not have a lot of actions, constants, reducers, sagas and selectors. The folder structure would be as follows:\n  - src\n    - actions\n      - actionFile1.js\n      - actionFile2.js\n    - components\n      - Component1\n        - index.js\n      - Component2\n        - index.js\n    - constants\n      - constantsFile1.js\n      - constantsFile2.js\n    - reducers\n      - reducersFile1.js\n      - reducersFile2.js\n    - sagas\n      - sagasFile1.js\n      - sagasFile2.js\n    - selectors\n      - selectorsFile1.js\n      - selectorsFile2.js\n    - container1.js\n    - container2.js\n\nThe difference here is that the actions, constants, reducers, sagas and selectors are now grouped together instead of in a separate container folder.\nWhy smart & dumb components?\nSmart and dumb components are the default way to setup a project at MOBGEN, and was the way it was learned to me during my first internship at MOBGEN. It is also an industry standard used by a lot of developers. A lot of articles are written on this subject on, for example, Medium, but also on the React website itself. I decided to use the smart and dumb component setup because:\n\nIt's scalable\nClear what does what\nEasy to understand\nFast and structured\nIndustry standard\n\nHow did I set up my project?\nTo explain the project structure, it is the easiest to show and describe what the most important files do.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    You would enter the application in the App.js file at the bottom of the image. Underneath this App.js is a file called reducers.js, this file takes all reducers from the containers, and puts them in the Redux store. The file sagas.js underneath the reducers.js file does the same, but then for the sagas of all the containers. In store.js we initialize the Redux store, this is the single source of truth all our data will be in.\n    In the folder 'containers' are all the screens of the application. Besides that there is a container call App. In app we render the navigator, which we initialize in the Navigator folder. We use the navigator to show the correct screens and to navigate through the application. Every time we navigate in the application the navigator requests a new screen/container to show.\n    Most of the containers have a set of files in them, these files are:\n    \n      actions.js\n      constants.js\n      index.js\n      reducer.js\n      sagas.js\n      selectors.js\n    \n  \n\n\nactions.js\nInside the actions.js files are the actions the container can perform. The actions are part of Redux, and as explained are pure functions (function that return the same things every time they are being called). Example of an action file:\n// importing the constants from the constants.js file in the same folder\nimport {\n  EXAMPLE_TYPE_REQUEST,\n  EXAMPLE_TYPE_SUCCESS,\n  EXAMPLE_TYPE_ERROR,\n} from './constants';\n\nexport const exampleActionRequest = id => ({\n  type: EXAMPLE_TYPE_REQUEST,\n  payload: id,\n});\nexport const exampleActionSuccess = id => ({\n  type: EXAMPLE_TYPE_SUCCESS,\n  payload: id,\n});\nexport const exampleActionError = error => ({\n  type: EXAMPLE_TYPE_ERROR,\n  error,\n});\n\nconstants.js\nInside the constants file are the constants that are used for this container. Most of the time there are three types of the same constant. One request, one success and one error. These constants are used in the actions, sagas, and reducer. Example of a constants file:\nexport const EXAMPLE_TYPE_REQUEST = 'ContainerName/EXAMPLE_TYPE_REQUEST'\nexport const EXAMPLE_TYPE_SUCCESS = 'ContainerName/EXAMPLE_TYPE_SUCCESS'\nexport const EXAMPLE_TYPE_ERROR = 'ContainerName/EXAMPLE_TYPE_ERROR'\n\nindex.js\nThis file contains the actual container. Most of the time it has a React in it. This file is what connects the container to the Redux store, and what is rendered on the users screen. Example of an index file:\n// importing the React library from the node_modules\nimport React from 'react';\n// importing the function that connects the container to the Redux store\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux';\n// importing the function that helps with creating selectors to select values from the Redux store\nimport { createStructuredSelector } from 'reselect';\n// Higher Order Component function that takes in a component, applies functions and returns a component\n// Used to add the mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps to the container\nimport compose from 'recompose/compose';\n// importing an example action from the actions file in this folder\nimport { exampleAction } from './actions';\n// importing the selectors that select the home title and an id from the Redux store\nimport { selectHomeTitle, selectHomeId } from './selectors';\n// importing a Title component from the components folder (this is a dumb component)\nimport Title from '../../components/Text/Title';\n// importing a Wrapper from the Wrapper.js file in this folder\nimport Wrapper from './Wrapper';\n\nclass ExampleContainer extends React.Component {\n  // When clicking on the Button, it will fire the exampleAction from the ./actions.js file\n  render() {\n    \n      {this.props.title}\n       this.props.action(this.props.id)}\n      />\n    \n  }\n}\n\n// Mapping selectors that return values to the props of this container\nconst mapStateToProps = createStructuredSelector({\n  title: selectHomeTitle(),\n  id: selectHomeId(),\n});\n\n// mapping actions to the props of this container\nfunction mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {\n  return {\n    action: id => dispatch(exampleAction(id)),\n  };\n}\n\n// This part connects the container to the Redux store\nexport default compose(\n  connect(\n    mapStateToProps,\n    mapDispatchToProps\n  )\n)(ExampleContainer);\n\nreducer.js\nThe reducer is a pure function that takes the current state of the reducer in the Redux store, makes a copy of that state and applies the changed values to that copy. Note that the state of the Redux store is never directly changed because of this way. An example of a reducer.js file is as follows:\n// importing the constant from './constants'\nimport { EXAMPLE_TYPE_SUCCESS } from './constants';\n\n// the initial state of this reducer, when the app loads this is applied\nconst initialState = {\n  title: null,\n  id: null,\n}\n\n// the reducer, it is listening for action.type (the constant) and when that is true,\n// it spreads the state (creating a new object) and applies the changed values to\n// this new object\nexport const exampleReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case EXAMPLE_TYPE_SUCCESS:\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        id: action.payload,\n      };\n    default:\n      return {\n        ...state,\n      };\n  }\n};\n\nsagas.js\nIn the sagas file we run a function when a certain value is true. These functions are middleware, which means they happen between the action and the reducer. When an action is fired you can lead it through a saga and after the saga pass it to the reducer. Sagas are ES6 generator functions, which means the functions wait for the current step to finish until they go to the next step. An example of a sagas file is as follows:\n// importing functions from the Redux Saga package from the node_modules\nimport { all, put, select, take, takeLatest } from 'redux-saga/effects';\n// importing the actions from the actions.js file in this folder\nimport {\n  exampleActionSuccess,\n  exampleActionError,\n} from './actions';\n// importing the constant the saga should listen for\nimport { EXAMPLE_TYPE_REQUEST } from './constants';\n// importing selectors\nimport {\n  makeSelectHomeTitleWithId,\n} from './selectors';\n\n// The ES6 generator function, notice the '*' after the function keyword\nfunction* exampleSaga(action) {\n  try {\n    // Since we are using yield, the function will stop and select the values\n    // from the store with the selector. When it is done selecting the values\n    // it will come back and continue.\n    const payload = yield select(makeSelectHomeTitleWithId(action.payload));\n    // After selecting a new payload from the store we yield put() a success action\n    yield put(exampleActionSuccess(payload))\n  } catch (error) {\n    // When things go wrong we yield put() the error action and fire an error\n    yield put(exampleActionError(error));\n  }\n}\n\n// This is the watcher that is listening for the EXAMPLE_TYPE_REQUEST to be fired\n// this constant is fired upon clicking on the button in the index.js file in this\n// folder. When is sees this EXAMPLE_TYPE_REQUEST it will fire the exampleSaga.\nfunction* exampleWatcher() {\n  yield all([\n    yield takeLatest(EXAMPLE_TYPE_REQUEST, exampleSaga),\n  ]);\n}\n\nselectors.js\nLast, but certainly not least, we have the selectors.js file. In this file are functions that are being used to select values from the Redux store. An example of a selectors.js file is as follows:\n// importing the createSelector function from reselect. This function creates memoized\n// selectors which means it is kept in the cache of the users memory, and faster when\n// called again\nimport { createSelector } from 'reselect';\n\n// selects the home reducer from the redux store (state)\nconst selectHomeDomain = state => state.home;\n\n// selects the title from an object with key id from the home reducer\nconst makeSelectHomeTitleWithId = id => createSelector(\n  [selectHomeDomain()],\n  (home) => {\n    const title = home.data[id].title;\n    return title;\n  }\n);\n\n// selects the title from the home reducer\nconst selectHomeTitle = () => createSelector(\n  [selectHomeDomain()],\n  (home) => home.title,\n);\n\n// Selects the id from the home reducer\nconst selectHomeId = () => createSelector(\n  [selectHomeDomain()],\n  (home) => home.id,\n);\n\n// exporting the selectors\nexport {\n  selectHomeDomain,\n  makeSelectHomeTitleWithId,\n  selectHomeTitle,\n  selectHomeId,\n};\n\nAll these files together make one functioning container, and one container is one screen in the application. Containers are smart, and they import dumb components that render the data the smart container passed to them.\nReferences\n\n1. Mangin, Alexis. (28-04-2016).

This design has to be translated to code. There are always many ways to translate these visual styles to code, as well in React Native. We have three options we can chose from when styling the application\n\nReact Native's StyleSheet\nStyled components\nGlamorous Native\n\nReact Native's StyleSheet 1\nI have used the React Native's StyleSheet in the first version of the Enso application. This solution works pretty well for small to semi-large applications, but when the application scales up to a bigger application it is nicer to have something with more functionalities build into it. Besides that it does not feel like you are writing actual css, as you are writing css in javascript. This means that border-radius has to be written down as: borderRadius. For a frontend developer this does not feels natural.\nStyled components 2\nI tried this package with the first release of the Enso application as well, but it had some major performance issues when used on the phones. Currently they released a new major version of the package (version 3.0.0 is now released), and this version fixes the performance issues. I have used the styled components library on web project before, and a lot of other developers at MOBGEN as well. This means they could easily understand how things were styled when they would join the Enso project. The styled components package has a lot of functionalities that make the development easier, and can also be used on the web.\nGlamorous Native 3\nGlamorous Native is pretty similar to Styled components but was specifically made for native projects as the name would suggest. The project is based on the Glamorous package that is used on web which is now being migrated to emotion. Glamorous is also heavily influenced on Styled components.\nConclusion\nIn the end I chose to use the styled component library because of the following reasons:\n\nYou can use the actual css syntax\nMyself and MOBGEN were familiar with the package from the web projects\nIt's more scalable compared to React Native's StyleSheet\nYou can do conditional styling based on the props of a component\n\nEventhough with Glamorous you can strip out the parser and have a smaller bundle size, I prefer the styled components. This is because I am familiar with the package and don't have to think about how to use it.\nReferences\n\n1. Facebook. (Date unknown). StyleSheet.

What is the goal of a design sprint?\nThe Design Sprint methodology is part of the agile approach to user experience and product design that puts the business, technology, and most particularly the user, in the centre. It is a structured process for tackling critical business questions through designing, prototyping, and testing new ideas with users through a three-to-five-day workshop.\nThe goal of the design sprint is to solve a complex business problem in a very short amount of time. This solution includes creating and testing a prototype at the end of the process.\nThe way the team on a design sprint solve this complex problem is by narrowing the it down to a single a challenge statement for the week. During the week the activities will focus on solving the challenge statement. Testing the prototype created during the sprint with real users is vital to have key learnings of what features and ideas worked and did not work. As well as judging if the team were successful in solving the challenge statement.\nThe goal of the prototype in the sprint is to be light weight and easily tested. It is not a detailed product, that could be brought to market. Instead the prototype often a simple clickable interface or sometimes even a paper prototype, as long as it gets the key learnings for the challenge statement. After the sprint the successful features of the prototype can be developed further to an MVP.\n1.2. What is the normal procedure for a design sprint?\nThe procedure for a design sprint combines 5 stages:\n\nUnderstand and Define\nDiverge\nConverge and Decide\nPrototype\nValidate\n\nThe sprint team consists of 5 to 8 participants mixing employees from MOBGEN and our client, each of whom were experts from different disciplines. In the sprint team, there are two key roles, the decider ‚Äì a person who makes the final call on a discussion, and a facilitator ‚Äì someone to run the week.\nMonday ‚Äì Understand & Define\nGuiding goals & questions | Map | Interview the experts | Target\nA design sprint normally start with initial team introductions and role definitions, and we introduced the Design Sprint plan and the sprint challenge. Summaries of the pre-sprint interviews results were presented shortly after.\nThe goal of the first day is to understand the client problem and needs.\nThe first group task is to write out the sprint guiding goals and questions on post-it notes and group them on the whiteboard.\nThe guiding goals are created by defining the questions the team needed to answer during the sprint. To help the team better understand the guiding goals, a facilitator can prepare the following questions for consideration:\n\nTo meet our long-term goal, what needs to happen?\nWhere do you want to be in 6 months, 1, or 5 years from now?\nWhat might cause failure to happen?\nHow will the solution integrate with the current application?\n\nSome of the Guiding Goals we defined included:\n\nDoes the solution support all markets?\nIs the navigation flexible to support future services?\nDoes the app make the user feel welcome as a guest on the app?\nIs the solution Simple?\nIs the solution Smart?\n\nThe second group task is normally to map out the user journeys in the app, and select a user type, and a user journey for more detailed consideration.\nThe third task is to have a number of Lightning Talks to interview experts from the business. These are thirty minute calls, where we explained the Design Sprint, presented our sprint guiding goals, the user journey, and asked for feedback from the business experts who were not part of the sprint team.\nDuring these calls, the sprint team writes down ‚Äòhow might we‚Äô notes, reframing each problem they hear during a call as an opportunity in the form of a question, beginning with the words ‚Äòhow might we‚Äô. These notes are written on post-it notes and after the call all the notes were captured and placed on a wall.\nAfter the calls the ‚Äòhow might we‚Äô (HMW) are organized into similar themes. The whole sprint team then need to agree and removed the themes that were out of scope. Then, sprint team members individually reviewed the long-term goal and the sprint questions. After this, the team has a vote, using sticky dots, to choose the most provoking and useful HMW questions. The notes with the most stickers were placed on the map next to the corresponding step in the customer‚Äôs journey.\nThe final task of the day is for the Decider to select the user type and the user journey the team would focus on for the rest of the week.\nTuesday ‚Äì Diverge\nRemix and Improve | Sketch\nThe first task is to research apps and websites that we felt we could learn from. This is for an exercise called lightning demos. During which each team member presents a handful of apps and websites that they liked and explained why. During each presentation, another member of the team would sketch the key ideas on the whiteboard.\nAfter the presentations, the team worked through four sketching exercises individually taking the ideas we liked and relating them to the guiding goals and user journey.\n\nNotes ‚Äì steps\nIndividually each participant reviews the long-term goal, the sprint questions, the map, the HMWs and the inspiring demos. Then they capture their own ideas and notes for the solutions that they can consider sketching in the upcoming ideation exercise.\nIdeas ‚Äì steps\nThe participants roughly jots down their ideas, diagrams, thoughts, doodles, sketches and headlines.\nCrazy 8s ‚Äì steps\nUsing A4 paper folded into 8 panels. Participants their strongest idea from the previous exercises and created variations of the idea in the remaining seven boxes. Spending one minute on each box.\nSketch solution ‚Äì steps\nUsing three mobile phone screen print-outs on A4 paper for this. Individually participants sketch their best idea in detail so it could be easily understood. They can add simple labels and added a catchy title. The choice of words is important in this exercise as each team member will privately review them on the following day.\n\nWednesday ‚Äì Decide\nDecide | Rumble | Storyboard\nThe first task for the team is to vote on their favorite sketches from the day before, after which the decider choses the four sketches that would be taken forward to the prototype.\nIn order to get to this decision:\nEach team member had 20 stickers. The team members review each solution sketch and vote on their favorite sketches and ideas and distribute their stickers between the sketches according to their preferences.\nAfter the voting, one team member spends up to 3 minutes presenting each solution sketch. They narrate the sketch and discussed any standout ideas that had clusters of stickers around them. Additionally, they reviewed and discuss all the concerns and questions listed for each solution sketch.\nAt the end, the sketch creator contributes anything missed or confused from the presentation. This process was repeated for each solution. At the end, the decider has a visual output and a complete understanding of all proposed solutions and should be able to choose the sketch the team would prototype.\nAfter the presentations the decider choses the solution that would be taken forward in the sprint. If the decider selects more than one solution, the group needs to agree whether to combine the chosen designs to create a single prototype, or to create two prototypes and compare the results of each one.\nNext, the team needs to create high level designs, combining the chosen sketch(es) into one design. The last step is to create a storyboard for the flows the group wants to test at the end of the Design Sprint.\nBefore the start of the 4th day, the team members split into the different roles needed to build the prototype on day 4. For example who will write the test plan, who will make the prototype, who will run the user test etc.\nThursday ‚Äì Prototype\nStart prototyping | Trial Run\nThe tasks for building a prototype often included:\n\nStart building the prototype and make it look as real as possible (The prototype does not have to be perfect)\nKeep it simple and focus on the main features that we want to test\nPlan interview questions\nPrepare Copy for the prototype\n\nAt the end of day 4, it‚Äôs encouraged to run a trial test with the prototype we, and the interview questions prepared for the user testing day.\nFriday ‚Äì Validate\nSmall Data | Interview | Learn\nThe most important question was ‚ÄúHow can we know if we did a good job?‚Äù In order to answer this question, teams use the prototype they created and ask different users to test it. Normally 5 testers, ideally customers come in on the user test day.\nDuring the tests an explanation of the context is given before starting the user tests, then the testers are asked some guiding questions.\nIn the interview room, the two interviewers introduce the prototype to the customers to get their authentic reactions while interacting with it. In the Sprint room, the rest of the team are taking notes on all customers reactions using post it notes and coloured markers (Green: Positive, Red: Negative, Black: Neutral). The team can see the interview using a camera in the user test interviews, often it is displayed on a large screen\nThe user test day consisted of r interviews, and the team was split into two groups: Interviewers and Observers. Two team members set up the interview room and asks questions, and the rest of the team watch camera feeds on a large screen and made notes on the interview.\nAfter the final interview, the sprint team comes together to review the notes, note down our lessons, and conclude the results of the day.\n1.3. Which people take part of a design sprint?\nIn principle, anyone can take part in a design sprint. A design sprint can be taken by who are trying to solve a problem via this methodology of rapid prototyping. At MOBGEN the type of people I have observed are: service designers, business analysts, product owners, subject matter specialist, marketers, developers and UI/UX designers.\nA team in a design sprint ranges between 5-8 people, from the business backgrounds listed above each person on the team during the print takes a particular role to assure the design sprint runs smoothly. In the design sprint there are three roles to fulfil:\n\nFacilitator(s)\nDecider\nParticipant\n\nFacilitator(s) are one or two people who plan and facilitate a design sprint. Before the design sprint begins facilitator plans the agenda for the design sprint, including what activities will happen on each day, when to fit in breaks and energisers, and setting up the user test interviews on the final day of the sprint.\nDuring the design sprint facilitators are responsible for explaining the agenda for each day and leading each activity in the agenda. The facilitator will instruct the team what to do, and sometimes prepare example work of what they expect to see at the end of an activity.\nAnother responsibility for a facilitator is to make sure all the activities run on time. This is key to their role as the design sprint has a tight schedule and the team can easily over run by diving in to discussions that don‚Äôt address the stated challenge for the week.\nFurthermore, a facilitator also needs to resolve any conflicts, or disagreements with in the team quickly, to keep the team focused. They can diffuse tensions and solve conflicts by offering the team a break, an energiser, open the issue up to a team vote, or give the decider the final word on an issue.\nThe decider is the person is the key decision maker on the team. The decider is normally the key stakeholder from the client, in MOBGEN they invite the product owner from the client to be the decider.\nThe deciders responsibilities are to make sure the team has a challenge statement is beneficial to them. To make final decisions on any issues or disagreements that rise during the sprint, and at the end of any team voting the decider needs to confirm they are satisfied with the team‚Äôs decision. If the decider is disagreeing with the team consensus, for example when voting on the best idea from the ideation round, they can overrule it and choose another idea to bring forward to a prototype. When this situation occurs, the facilitator should help manage the situation to try and keep everyone happy and focused on the task.\nParticipants are the rest of the team involved in the design sprint, they participate in all the activities organized by the facilitator. Participants make an impact on the design sprint especially when they bring their ideas of how to solve the challenge for the week during the ideation rounds, voting on different options presented during the week and building the prototype.\nConclusion\nA design sprint is a three to five-day process of generating ideas quickly, creating and testing a rough prototype with real users as soon as possible, learn from mistakes. This process can be repeated as many times as necessary, until the prototype has positive outcomes and valuable results\nThe design sprint process combines 5 stages:\n\nUnderstand and Define\nDiverge\nConverge and Decide\nPrototype\nValidate\n\nThe benefits of using the design sprint methodology is that it saves time and money:\nSave time\nThe Design Sprint was specifically invented to dramatically shorten up the innovation loop: this means faster go-to-market, a quicker round of feedback from the user, and no more time-consuming prototyping for not valuable ideas. That sounds like a lot of time saved.\nSave money\nBy quickly identifying a relevant problem that needs to be solved, and an impactfull solution to that problem, a Design Sprint quickly sets a direction for innovation, preventing the company from spending a lot of money into not primary projects, or in ideas that eventually would not meet users‚Äô needs.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

These two groups have different needs and wants. Facilitators are in control of the workshop they are giving, and participants are only participating in a workshop. Based on the interviews and observations, the facilitators want to be able to create their own sprint in the application and be able to edit it. The facilitators just want to get information like the planning of the day, the descriptions of the exercises and how long they have to finish an exercise.\nIn a later stadium in the project I decided that making a separate participants version of the application would cost too much time. I decided to only focus on the facilitators, and the create sprint feature.\n2.1. What are their needs and wants of the Enso application?\nThe needs and wants of the target audiences differ a bit from each other. A facilitator wants and needs a lot more from the application to make the application useful. A participant needs and wants less. I have split the needs and wants of the two target audience groups into sub-question.\n\nFacilitators needs and wants\nParticipants needs and wants\n\nI already did this research before deciding to not focus on the participants anymore.\n2.2. What do we have that the competitors don‚Äôt have?\nIn the current version we don't have any extra features that our biggest competitor, Duco, does not have, we probably have less if you are not a MOBGEN employee. Both the Duco and Enso app give the user a design sprint agenda that is not editable. Duco gives the user a design sprint agenda that can practically be used for most of the design sprints. The design sprints in the current Enso app are all customized to suit the clients needs. A random user probably prefers the Duco app over the Enso app because it's everywhere-to-use agenda.\nWith the addition of the new feature where users can configure their own sprints and edit agendas to make them suit their needs. If the feature is released we have a big advantage over the competition. There is currently no other design sprint tool or workshop tool that allows its users to configure their own workshop in the way we plan to do. We think Enso can be market leader in workshop planning tools with the new feature.\nConclusion\nThere are two groups in the target audience for the Enso application. The facilitators who use the application to run the workshop and the participants that use the application to get information for the workshop they are in. I dropped the participants group when I decided to only focus on the create sprint feature due to the amount of time I had.\nThe Enso application does not have a direct competitor that aims to do the same.

If a facilitator wants to run a custom sprint in the application with a custom agenda, he has to get in contact with Yoav Farbey, and ask Yoav to add the sprint agenda to our backend system: Halo. This process takes long and when the facilitator wants to change something it takes a while. When a facilitator wants to edit the duration or the order of some of the events in a certain agenda, Yoav has to change this in Halo. This takes way to long to be done during a sprint.\nThe main point of criticism the Enso application got is that it is not adaptable enough to the needs and wants of the facilitators. What they want to do in the application, creating their own sprints/workshops, can not be done at the moment.\n3.1. Why do these problems exist, and in what way are they problems?\nThese problems exist because the first version of the Enso application was a prototype to test if using an app during a design sprint is useful or not. In the initial release of the application there was one sprint active that was showed to all users. The screen where you can select a specific sprint was not there at all. Later it was clear that the facilitators all ran their design sprints differently, and needed configurable agendas. The fix for that was to add them by hand to the backend system. This was working fine for some time, but it was clear we had to implement this feature in the application.\n3.2. When do these problems occur and how often?\nThe problem that the facilitator has, is that during a sprint things change, and so the agenda has to change as well. The problems occur during a sprint, which is a stressful time for the facilitator. The facilitator can not focus on changing backend values during a design sprint. He only has time to change a duration or delete an event from the agenda, so things have to be fast. During one of the interviews with Valentina she told me that it happens often that the duration or the order of events change midway through a design sprint. She also told me that sometimes events get skipped because of lack of time.\n3.3. Is there a way these problems can be prevented?\nThe way I think we can prevent these problems is to give facilitators the option to do quick things like removing an event, updating the duration or reordering events in the application. This should be possible to do in a very short period of time, so the facilitator can stay focussed on the design sprint itself, and not on Enso. Enso should not be the focus point during the design sprint, it should even feel natural and quick to update something in Enso.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

They want to be able to adapt design thinking methodologies such as the design sprint, to fit the clients and projects they are working on. They want to have a planning that they can share with the participants, and want to be able to adjust that planning even during the sprint or workshop.\n4.1. Why does a facilitator want to do this?\nThe Enso tool can provide facilitators with a way to adapt a design thinking methodology to fit the clients and projects they are working on. They can do this using a simple interface, that allows them to move, remove and add activities from their agenda.\nAnother reason for wanting to use this tool is that it makes the learning curve of understanding the workshop easier, looking at the interviews I carried a lot of the feedback was along the lines of ‚ÄúAnyone could facilitate a design sprint with this‚Äù, ‚ÄúI already have a lot more insight in what it takes to run a design sprint‚Äù see appendix. This shows the application can help train up facilitators quickly\n4.2. Is the application the best solution for the goals a facilitator has, or can a different solution give better results?\nThe facilitators have one big goal during a design sprint, and that is to come to a good solution via a prototype, together with the client. They also have numerous sub-goals during a design sprint. They want all the participants to cooperate with each other to come to a solution, they want everything they tell and explain to be clear and they want to give a participant complete clarity on the planning and how the sprint is going to look like.\nThere are other options to run a design sprint, but no other option suits the facilitators needs they say. It is the main reason MOBGEN started to look for a custom solution to their problem. The facilitators used to use an Excel sheet for the planning for example, but that did not work perfectly. The Excel sheet had to be shared with the client via a link, so the client could see the planning of the day. If the facilitator wanted to change the duration of an event the Excel sheet did not always recalculate the other event times correctly. This resulted in a planning that did not match the day, or the facilitator changing all the other event times by hand.\nIt is difficult at the moment to find a good tool that works for the facilitators. Most of the solutions are based on Word documents or Excel sheets, that do not automatically adjust based on the content, or are easily shared with a client. During one conversation with the facilitators I noticed that they are enthusiastic about the next release of the Enso application, because it gives them the ability to adjust a planning quick and easy, and to focus more on the design sprint itself.\nFor that reason I think there are no other solutions that can solve the problem in an easier way. The facilitators mentioned that they have been searching for a better solution for quite some time, but were not able to find a better alternative than an Excel sheet. They also said that the Excel sheet is not their preferred way of working.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

This includes having a better overview of the details of the Agenda for each day, the details of the for each activity and how long each activity will take.\n5.1. What information is important for the participant of a design sprint?\nParticipants need to know the agenda for the design sprint. This can be shared with them via the application before the design sprint. This helps set the expectations for the team of what will happen during the workshop. This can help eliminate worries from participants who are worried about not knowing what will happen during the workshop.\nSharing the agenda for the design sprint will also mean the team will be aligned on what they expect to happen throughout the sprint.\nDuring the design sprint participants need to know the activity instructions, what they need to do and how long they have to complete the task. Participants may also want to have examples of completed tasks in order to better understand, what they are expected to do during the activity.\nParticipants need to know how much time they have left for a given task.

I needed to know some values from the user to create a new sprint. I also needed the user to be focussed on a single task, and make the flow as quickly as possible while still remaining being focussed on a single task.\nI had to find out what these values were and what the best practices were around requesting these values from the user.\n2.1 What information is needed to create a sprint and how do you visually request this from the user?\nTogether with the facilitators at MOBGEN, the designers, Lan and Alejandro and the Product owner of Enso, Yoav, we made a list of the information that was needed to create a sprint. The list of values we needed was:\n\n\n\nValue\nRequired\n\n\n\n\nName\nYes\n\n\nChallenge\nNo\n\n\nTemplate\nYes\n\n\nDates\nYes\n\n\nParticipants\nNo\n\n\n\nWe needed the name to quickly show the difference between two sprints for the user of the application. The name would also be displayed big on the overview screen where the user can select a sprint, this value is required in the create sprint flow.\nThe challenge is something for the user, to further specify what the sprint is about. What is the goal of the sprint.\nWe had to know which template the user wants to use for this sprint, so that one is required as well.\nWe also ask the user to select the dates the design sprint will be ran, to order the design sprints chronologically, this value is also required.\nLastly we ask the user the number of participants, which could be used to display equipment values for an event and specific tips. For example how big the room should be for an exercise.\nTo visually request this information from the user I used a wizard. With the wizard we could request this information screen by screen, as described in the create sprint pattern research section. I also used the structured format pattern to make it easier for the user to understand what values had to be filled in. For example: showing a calendar when requesting a date value. This solution forced the user to focus on one task at the time when creating a sprint.\nSee the UX prototype to see how the designs ended up being.\n2.2 What are best practices around requesting values from a user in a mobile application?\nI looked at the following patterns for the creation of a new sprint on a mobile application. To see the detailed pattern description go to the  create sprint pattern research section.\nI looked at three patterns that could be applied when creating a sprint in the application:\n\nGood defaults\nWizard\nStructured format\n\nIn the end I combined the wizard with the structured format to make a create-sprint flow where the user focusses on one input at the time, with the least amount of steps needed to be taken. This solution was tested with multiple people at MOBGEN, and overall they were enthusiastic about it and how it worked. Most of them thought it was very intuitive and clear what was expected from them.\nAfter the user tests I had some feedback on the designs. I tried to apply the feedback to the designs during development, to speed up the process, and to spend more time on development. This means that the UX prototype can differ a bit from the actual iOS or Android prototype.\nI also ran into some restrictions with React Native during the development, or had to solve things a bit differently due to time pressure. You can download the prototype via the Prototype page.\nSee the UX prototype to see how the designs ended up being.\n"},"docs/research-questions/design/agenda-and-event-best-practices.html":{"url":"docs/research-questions/design/agenda-and-event-best-practices.html","title":"Agendas and event best practices","keywords":"","body":"Agenda and event best practices\nDesign research question\n\n1.1 How do you give the user the ability to edit an existing agenda?\nTo find out how users of the application could edit the agenda in a user friendly way, I first started to think about which values should be editable for the users.\nI came up with the following list:\n\nMark event as done\nRemove event\nReorder event\nAdd event\n\nAfter I made this list of values that should be editable, I looked into some design patterns that showed how other applications managed to do this. I reviewed these patterns, together with two designers that were already involved with the Enso application, Alejandro and Lan. They are both UX/UI designers at MOBGEN and mostly work on the Shell Drive application. Together with them I selected the best option to add to the UX prototype.\nThe patterns I looked into were:\n\nEdit mode\nSingle item edit\nMass edit\n\nTogether with the two experts, Alejandro and Lan, we decided to go for an edit mode that had to be activated by the user. I then made a couple of iterations of the preferred pattern that could work for the Enso application, and finally made a version of the pattern that I tested during the UX user testing. After the user tests I had some feedback on the designs, that I implemented during the development.\nDuring the development I also ran into some technical obstacles, that forced me to create something that might not always look 100% similar to the designs. This was because of time pressure and restrictions of React Native and my React Native knowledge.\nSee the UX prototype to see how the designs ended up being.\n1.2 How do you give the user the ability to edit an existing sprint or event?\nEditing sprint values and event values are quite similar to each other. For consistency I wanted to use the same pattern for these two functionalities. I used the iOS pattern that Apple uses to give their users the ability to edit values. In the UX tests the participants could easily find this edit button, and were fermilliar with it.\nThe user should be able to edit the following sprint values:\n\nName\nChallenge\nTemplate\nDates\nParticipants\nSprint day title\nSprint day start time\n\nFor event I the user should be able to edit the following values\n\nEquipment\nTips\nDuration\n\nFor this release I decided not to give the users the ability to edit the events title or description. This was to speed up the development process a bit. In a future release the user should be able to edit these values and configure the sprint even more.\nI looked at how other applications enabled their users to edit values, for example user name or email values. This can be found in the edit-sprint section, and selected three patterns:\n\nWYSIWYG editor\nSingle screen form\nInplace editor\n\nI asked the help of the two experts again, and thought about the situation this feature will be used in, which is before or during a design sprint. The editting had to be fast, but it was also important that no accidental edit happened. We decided to add the single screen form to the UX prototype so we could test that.\nWith this solution it is very clear to the users which values can be editted and it is hard to make accidental edits. The user has to actively go to a different page and click on a save button to change values. While it is hard to accidentally change a value, participants of the UX user tests could still quickly edit a value if they wanted to.\nSee the UX prototype to see how the designs ended up being.\n"},"docs/research-questions/technical/":{"url":"docs/research-questions/technical/","title":"Technical","keywords":"","body":"Technical\nResearch questions\n\nFor the technical questions I looked at the restrictions of the framework I selected to use, ways to structure my project and how to write scalable, reusable and maintainable code.\n\nRestrictions of React Native\nCodebase best practices\nWriting scalable, reusable & maintainable code\n\n"},"docs/research-questions/technical/restrictions-of-react-native.html":{"url":"docs/research-questions/technical/restrictions-of-react-native.html","title":"Restrictions of React Native","keywords":"","body":"Restrictions of React Native\nTechnical research question\n\nReact Native is a library that enables a developer to write a cross-platform application using a single codebase. React Native comes from the React package that was made for the web. React Native runs the javascript code the developers write and runs this on the users device. In contrast to PhoneGap or Cordova it is not a webview layer in a native wrapper, but actual javascript code that runs on the phone.\nThis means with React Native you can use some of the native functionalities that a phone offers. Examples of these native functionalities are: a fingerprint scanner, notifications, vibrations, location or the phones local storage. With this also comes the first restriction. At the time of writing this, most of the native modules are supported in React Native. But when it was just released you could not use some of those native modules the phone has. Facebook (the creator of React and React Native) had to add this to the React Native project first, or some developer had to make this feature and make a pull request in the React Native repository on GitHub to get it into the project.\nThis takes time, so when a new native module is introduced, React Native apps cannot immediately use it, or you would still need native Java (Android) and Swift (iOS) developers to make use of this new native module.\nAnother issue I had with React Native was navigation. React Native only supports iOS navigation out of the box, and suggest to use the react-navigation package when developing an application. This react-navigation package is wildly complicated at first sight, when you never did any mobile development, and only did web development. You will drown in Stack, Tab and Drawer Navigators, and soon you have no idea how to setup you navigator.\nIt is more complex than navigating on the web. I tried to use other navigation packages, such as react-native-navigation (made by Wix, the website-builder-website), and react-router (react-router is the router you use in React for web). Performance and navigational speaking react-navigation was the best package. In React Native: navigating is hard.\nLastly there are some performance issues when doing heavy hardware actions in a React Native application. Take Pinterest for example, they looked into React Native and asked themselves if they could write their application with it. The short answer was: 'no'. Their native applications were optimized to handle the unlimited scrolling feature they have. It was not possible to match the same performance with React Native. 1 2 3\n1.1 How can you solve those restrictions?\nThe lack of support of native modules is already getting less and less. A lot of the native modules are already supported or can be supported using community made packages. If the native module you need is not yet supported by React Native itself, and there was no developer from the community that decided to make a package that enables support of this native module, you end up needing iOS and Android developers to help you out. They would have to write an implementation for the native module and forward those functions to React Native.\nNavigation is still a problem. It is not really a restriction as it will work, but customizing the navigation is very limited. During the project I had a lot of problems figuring out how to set up the navigator and to control the way containers would enter the screen. Maybe for a native developer this would be easier, but for someone coming from the web development area, it did not always make sense.\nLastly the performance is also still a problem, and I don't see this being fixed in the near future. The main issue with this is that the code that is executed is not native code. It is Javascript that is running in the JavascriptCore engine (the engine that runs in Safari as well). Native code will always be faster and perform better than non-native code. However, for building user interfaces in a way where you can reuse them on the web as well React Native is a very good solution.\n1.2 What other alternatives are there instead of React Native?\nThere are multiple alternatives to React Native or alternatives to develop iOS and Android applications.\n\n\n\nAlternative\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nIonic\nIonic is very similar to React Native. You could say Ionic the the Angular Native of Angular.\n\n\nPhoneGap/Cordova\nPhonegap/Cordova is wrapping a webview in a native container. You can make an application out of an existing website very easily.\n\n\nXamarin\nXamarin is a way of creating cross-platform applications which makes use of the C# language to create the code\n\n\nProgressive¬†Web¬†Apps\nA fairly new option in the list of competitors. With progressive web apps a user can 'download' a website to their phone, and this website has access to some native modules like notifications.\n\n\nFlutter\nFlutter is the React Native competitor from Google. It uses the Dart language. With Flutter the user can\n\n\nNative¬†iOS¬†and¬†native¬†Android\nThese are well known options most applications are build in.\n\n\n\n1.3 What are advantages of React Native?\nThe advantages of React Native are the fact that you can quickly develop an iOS and Android application with a single codebase. However, most of the competitors can do this as well, so this is only an advantage over native development. For native development you will still need to create two codebases, one for each platform.\nThe community behind React and React Native is massive. It has a solid number 4 in the most used frameworks in the 2017 Stackoverflow survey 4, and is the most loved framework 5 according to the over 64.000 developers who filled in the survey 6. React Native itself has close to 65.000 stars on GitHub and has 1.676 contributors working on it 7.\nBesides the above React Native has some advantages for developers that come from web development, especially those who have worked with React for web. React Native is written in the Javascript language, which is well known by almost all web developers and is the most popular programming language 8. This makes it easy for them to switch to native development because they don't have to learn a new language.\nReact is already well known by the MOBGEN developers, so for me this was an advantage React Native had as well. If I had questions I could easily ask them to other developers working at MOBGEN.\nFor the Enso team it was an advantage that with React Native we could have only one developer working on both the iOS and Android application. This was an advantage because there is no budget for this project, and only interns or unassigned employees can work on this project.\nReferences\n\n1. Shah, H. (23-11-2017).

Following best practices in development prevents dirty code that is not understandable anymore.\n2.1 What different ways are there to set up a project?\nThere are almost unlimited ways to setup a project in development, but some are more convenient than others. I did research to project structures in the project structure section of the technical phase. I describe the smart and dumb components setup with the help of an article of Dan Abramov, who is one of the creators of React and Redux.\nThis way of setting up a project is used in many of the beginner tuturials, but also in some of the biggest projects MOBGEN did. The Shell Oasis project I worked on also used this setup, and the KPN project MOBGEN is using it. Dennis Korff, senior frontend developer at MOBGEN also told me this is currently the preferred way of setting up React project in a conversation we had about this topic 1.\nIn the end there are certainly many ways to set up a project, but the setup I used is the most common. The use of containers and components is also explained in the official React tutorial by Facebook 2\nPutting this in practice, my project was setup following two guidelines, the smart and dumb components one, and a Redux structure aimed at medium to large scale projects. The setup is explained in detail on the project structure page.\n2.2 How do you deal with all the side effects that happen on mobile?\nOn a mobile phone a lot of side effects happen. Side effects are actions that interrupt a process. For example fetching data from a server when suddenly the user quits the application. To handle these side effects I made use of a very powerful package: Redux Saga.\nRedux saga is a library that aims to make application side effects (i.e. asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) easier to manage, more efficient to execute, simple to test, and better at handling failures. 3\nRedux Saga is a middleware that lives between the actions and the reducers. You can call a saga function with an action, the saga listener will listen for a specific action to be fired, and then call the corresponding saga function. This saga function is an ES7 generator function 4. You can recognize them by the * behind the function keyword. A saga function looks like this: function* generatorFunction() { ... }.\nAn example saga looks like this:\n// importing the Redux Saga functions I used\nimport { cancel, put, select, take, takeLatest } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { exampleSagaSuccessAction, exampleSagaErrorAction } from './actions';\nimport { EXAMPLE_ACTION_REQUEST } from './constants';\nimport { LOCATION_CHANGE } from '../Navigator/constants';\nimport { makeSelectObjectFromStore } from './selectors';\n\n// The generator function\nfunction* exampleSaga() {\n  try {\n    // When this function is fired it is going to select an object from the Store\n    const payload = yield select(makeSelectObjectFromStore());\n    // The generator function waits until the yield above returns a value\n    // And will continue the function.\n    // It would 'put' (call) on of the imported actions.\n    yield put(exampleSagaSuccessAction(payload));\n  } catch (error) {\n    // When the function catches an error it would 'put' (call) the error action\n    // I imported above.\n    yield put(exampleSagaErrorAction(error));\n  }\n}\n\n// This function is a so called 'watcher' that watches for the EXAMPLE_ACTION_REQUEST\n// to be fired in the application. When that happens it runs the exampleSaga.\n// When LOCATION_CHANGE occurs this function will cancel the 'watcher' and cancel the\n// running saga.\n// This function is exported and imported and used in the Redux store where it is added\n// as a middleware.\nexport function* watchexampleSaga() {\n  const watcher = yield takeLatest(EXAMPLE_ACTION_REQUEST, exampleSaga);\n  yield take(LOCATION_CHANGE);\n  yield cancel(watcher);\n}\n\nWhat this does is give you way more control over which fetch calls or selectors are running in your application. When the user starts a fetch and decides to navigate away from the screen, you can very easily cancel this request with the saga.\nReferences\n\n1. Korff, D. (02-06-2018).

To enforce consistency in  a project, a developer can use a couple of tools. Using a modern editor (VSCode, WebStorm or something similar) it is possible to add a linter to the code editor. This linter is a program that checks the code as it is being written down. It will give the developer warnings when the code is not consistent or when the code that is written down is outdated or not adviced. There are a couple of linters available, but in the Enso project I used ESLint 1. When I make a mistake in the code it shows you the following:\n\nThe ESLint plugin is checking against a lot of rules. At MOBGEN the developers use the Airbnb setup with some additional rules added to the setup. This enforces the developers to write the same type of code. The ESLint also checks against the indentation of the code and returns an error when the indentation is not correct.\nAnother package that I used in the project that was adviced by Dennis Korff, senior developer at MOBGEN 2, was the Prettier package 3. Prettier is an an autoformatter for your code. When you hit save it automatically reformats the code following the ESLint rules that are set up for the Prettier plugin.\nA good pattern that should be followed and is considered a best practice as well is the smart and dumb components pattern I explain in the project structure section. With this pattern logic is separated from visual components.\nTo keep the code consistent and clean we did code reviews as well. This is explained in the next section a bit more, as it is part of the Git workflow.\n3.2 How can you work with a version control system, and why is it considered indispensable in a project?\nWhen working on a development project, there is nothing worse than code loss. To prevent this, Git was used. Git is a version control system made by Linus Thorvalds 4. Git works with branches that basically have a copy of the project on them. For example you have the master branch that contains the latest release of an application, a development branch that contains features that are done for a next release, and most of the time multiple feature/branch-name branches where developers work on their own separate features 5.\nWithout Git or another version control system you are constantly copying files between developers, which is very error sensitive. You want to prevent that. Another benefit of using a version control system is the possibility to go back in history and run an older version of the app. This could be useful when, for some reason, the current branch has errors on them and the developer wants to check where these errors slipped into the project. Git serves as a history tool for those situations.\nBesides that you can do very structured code reviews when using a branching model like the one Vincent Driessen describes on his blog 6. When a feature branch is being merged into the development branch, the developer that requests this merge assigns a couple of developers as reviewers to this request. The assigned developers will then check the code for any inconsistencies or errors before it gets merged into the development branch. This way you ensure that everything that is on the development branch is actually working. 7\nBelow is an example of how such pull request looks like:\n\n3.3 How can you make sure the code you write will work as expected?\nDoing code reviews is a big part of making sure that the code works as expected. A second set of eyes and brains that scan the code can already prevent many bugs or help you with improving your code. Another good practice is to do unit tests on the code. Unit testing is breaking your application into smaller pieces and subjecting these pieces to a number of tests you have written for them 8.\nImagine the following function:\nexport function sum(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\nTo unit test this function you can:\n// call the function\nsum(2, 4) // should return 6\n\nFunctions in real world applications are most of the time a bit more complex, but it is still important to test these functions. For testing in React, Facebook made a package named Jest. With Jest you can run the tests in your command line. An example of a unit test with jest would be as follows:\nImagine we have the following function again:\nexport function sum(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\nWith jest we can test this function as follows:\nimport { sum } from './sum';\n\ntest('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {\n  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);\n});\n\nJest will run this test and add the passed flag when the test returns true. With the smart and dumb components setup that was described earlier it is easier to do the unit tests as well. Your dumb components only render the data, so they are easy to test.\nThe unit tests are a good way to keep track of which properties every component receives. When another developer changes some things in a component, runs the tests and they suddenly fail, he or she knows something is not correct and has to change. This way you will prevent unexpected errors. 9\n\nReferences\n\n1. Author unknown. (Date unknown). ESLint documentation. Consulted on 08-06-2018 from: https://eslint.org/ ‚Ü©\n\n\n2. Korff, D.

It was very clear the application was not useful enough without it. Enso already made a name for itself internally at MOBGEN | Accenture Interactive, and with this new feature we can finally release the application publicly as well.\nYoav Farbey, product owner and initiator of Enso, is very happy with the end result. The frontend team was impressed with what I managed to create in React Native, without the help of Native iOS or Android developers (there was no money for native developers).\nLooking back at the project I would have spend less time on concept, because it was clear very soon what the problem with the application was. I could have spend more time on either design or development that way. For design an extra iteration on the UX would have been an improvement. For development more time would have meant more streamlined code, and maybe some cool animations.\nReflecting on the design challenge:\n‚ÄúHow could the current Enso application give facilitators of design sprints the possibility to configure and manage workshops in the application for both Android and iOS with a single codebase?‚Äù\nI think I managed to find a solution for the challenge. I was also able to develop a working prototype for Android and iOS, using a single codebase. This prototype was based on the research to the target audience, best practices for designs, user tests that validated the design decisions and research to project setups and coding best practices. During the project I still kept in mind that React Native could have some performance issues with hardware heavy tasks, this helped me to develop the new feature quickly.\nI build a feature that can be released in the next Enso release with a little bit of refactoring and streamlining of the code.\f\n"}}}
